"CNN reached out to New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's office and the NYPD for comment on the seven-minute video. Julia Arredondo, a spokeswoman for de Blasio, said Saturday the mayor and Shea remain working partners. ""As shown in their hour-long press conference together on Friday, the mayor and commissioner are closely working together to beat back crime,"" Arredondo said. The day after his fiery speech, Shea appeared with de Blasio at the mayor's daily press briefing, where the pair rolled out a citywide violence prevention plan that included redeploying assets to areas heavily affected by gun violence.  The speech from Shea comes as the city is dealing with an uptick in shootings and homicides that it hasn't seen in nearly two decades. Through July 12, the city has recorded 634 shootings compared to 394 for the same period last year, a 60% increase. There have been 203 murders so far in 2020, a 23% jump compared to same time period in 2019, when the city recorded 165 killings. During the brief speech, Shea said that, according to officials, 20 people ""touch 100 shootings,"" without specifying the time frame. Shea said that the city may not need 1 million or 10,000 people in jail, but ""these goddamn 20 people need to go jail."" The speech mirrored what a number NYPD officials have espoused since the height of the George Floyd demonstrations in New York City: Police officers are now confronted with anti-police rhetoric that has gained support from city lawmakers and that has emboldened some to commit crimes, contributing in part to the spike in violence. ""You are going to be incredibly tested -- incredibly tested, probably in the months to come this is not a short term problem. They have screwed this city up so much in a short period of time, it's going to take us a time to get it -- our arms around it,"" Shea said. ""It's already started I believe. Cops are incredibly challenged in how they can police today. There's no question."" The speech comes after de Blasio's recent signing of a  , which include a law that bans the use of a chokehold, but also police officers sitting on someone's back or using a knee during an arrest. NYPD officials say the new laws have made officers more hesitant to make arrests because it takes away a key crime tool in subduing a suspect during a tense arrest. Officials have said the changes contribute to not only the rise in violence, but low morale.  ""I don't know that there's ever been a period exactly like this where so many systems of government are literally cowards that won't stand up for what's right,"" Shea said. ""They're failing at every possible measure to be leaders. And they throw it onto the backs of the men and women of this police department and curse them with one hand and then blame them with the other. How dare they?"" ""They don't have a goddamn clue what they're talking about but we are not going to let them destroy this city,"" Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said during a CompStat briefing on Thursday. ""People that don't have a clue about how to keep New Yorkers safe suddenly think they know about policing.""

"It urged the US government to undertake immediate preparations for human challenge trials, ""including supporting safe and reliable production of the virus and any biocontainment facilities necessary to house participants."" The letter said human challenge trials -- in which volunteers are deliberately exposed to the pathogen under controlled conditions -- can provide information months before conventional efficacy trials, in which candidates receive a vaccine or control and resume their normal life, with the assumption that they may be eventually exposed to the virus. More than 2,000 challenge trial   also signed the letter published by 1Day Sooner, an organization advocating on their behalf. Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford in England, and signatory of the open letter, wrote in a statement that ""collaborative human challenge studies should be feasible and informative in the coming months."" Oxford's Jenner Institute is working with 1Day Sooner to produce a Covid-19 human challenge virus and Hill said it had ""considerable potential"" for helping to accelerate vaccine development and optimize vaccination approaches. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued   in May saying challenge studies can be ""substantially faster"" and more effective than other methods, in part because fewer participants need to be exposed to experimental vaccines and because they can be used to compare potential vaccines. Challenge trials were used in early research with smallpox, yellow fever and malaria, which changed the course of global public health, according to WHO. Over the past 50 years, tens of thousands of consenting adult volunteers have safely undergone such trials under the oversight of research ethics committees, WHO reported.  It said controlled infection trials could be ethically acceptable if they met certain criteria. These include choosing young and healthy adults as participants, starting with low doses, ensuring public engagement, and providing high-quality care and close monitoring. The notion of a   for Covid-19 was jump-started by a March 31 article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, which made the case that the nature of the global emergency warranted consideration of unconventional approaches. Co-authored by Nir Eyal of Rutgers, Marc Lipsitch of Harvard, and Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the piece concluded that while a human challenge study would not be without risks, ""every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally."" But members of the NIH's Accelerating Covid-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) Vaccines Working Group said earlier this month that   would not speed up vaccine development. In a commentary published in the New England Journal of Medicine, ACTIV members wrote that using controlled human infection models to support vaccine development requires ""essential criteria"" to limit the risk for participants and could take ""one to two years."" ""A single death or severe illness in an otherwise healthy volunteer would be unconscionable and would halt progress,"" they wrote.  They said it would be unethical to organize an experiment in which people were deliberately infected unless there were a rescue therapy -- a treatment that can save lives -- which does not exist for coronavirus. ""Large, randomized, controlled trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently the most efficient, generalizable, and scientifically robust path to establishing vaccine efficacy,"" the authors concluded. They said so-called ""human challenge trials"" or ""controlled infection trials"" were of ""vast importance"" in speeding up the testing of the vaccines in development around the world. ""If challenge trials can safely and effectively speed the vaccine development process, there is a formidable presumption in favor of their use, which would require a very compelling ethical justification to overcome,"" the scientists wrote in   to Dr. Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH).","By Emma Reynolds, CNN",health,"Updated 9:08 AM ET, Thu July 16, 2020 ",Nobel laureates call for 'challenge trials' to speed up vaccine process,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/16/health/vaccine-open-letter-challenge-trials-intl-gbr/index.html
"While federal law now requires insurers, Medicare and Medicaid to cover the tests at no cost to patients and provides funding to cover costs for testing the uninsured, limits to the federal requirements mean that some patients may still receive bills, Kaiser said.  The typical list price for the test was $127, and about half of hospitals charge between $100 and $199. Nearly one in five price their tests at more than $200.   The price varies based on type of test performed,  and the manufacturer.   were generally less expensive that non-CDC tests. Tests that allow for faster analysis of samples cost more. Some hospitals offer a discounted rate for patients who pay themselves, with the cost ranging from $36 to $180. Other hospitals say that the uninsured or those paying themselves can receive free or discounted care through financial assistance programs. Some insurers and hospitals may also negotiate a price for tests done out-of-network. Medicare reimburses providers $51 or $100 per test, depending on its type. There is no cost-sharing for enrollees. Though the two coronavirus relief bills Congress passed in March sought to eliminate cost-sharing for those seeking testing, some patients may still get bills, Kaiser found. They include some people who sought care but were not actually given a test, some who were tested at out-of-network facilities and some who have health insurance plans that don't meet Affordable Care Act requirements, such as short-term policies.  Also, the federal rules don't apply to tests conducted as part of employee ""return to work"" programs, though The list price for   range from $35 and $300 at hospitals that provide their charges. Most charge less than $150. The analysis sought to examine publicly posted prices at the two largest hospitals in each state and the District of Columbia. Federal law requires hospitals to make this information available on their websites, but prices could only be found for 78 of the 102 hospitals reviewed. The prices reflect the charges for out-of-network services since data on negotiated rates for in-network care is not available. More than 695,000 Covid-19 daily test results were confirmed, on average, in early July, Kaiser said. The   has overwhelmed laboratories running the tests. They are getting more samples than they can process, the American Clinical Laboratory Association said Tuesday. ""In light of the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in states across the country, many labs are now receiving more test orders than they are able to process in a single day,"" Julie Khani, the association's president, said in a statement. ""We have urged ordering providers to prioritize testing for those most in need, especially hospitalized and symptomatic patients."" On Monday, Quest Diagnostics said some of its tests were taking seven days to turn around because of the demand.  Without quick testing, people cannot know whether they have the virus and take steps to avoid spreading it. Fast testing is central to contact tracing, the method that public health experts say is key to controlling the spread of the pandemic. It found that large facilities nationwide charge between $20 and $850 for each test, not including the cost of the provider visit, facility fee or other services.  These fees do not reflect rates that hospitals negotiate with insurers for in-network care.

"The head of a hospital system in hard-hit Miami-Dade County, Florida, told CNN that they plan to convert some regular rooms into ones that can handle the most serious coronavirus patients should the growth in cases continue. Carlos Migoya said the situation is ""very, very tight"" at Jackson Health System, but they have stopped doing elective surgeries to help save beds. ""This room is not going to last forever,"" if the numbers keep rising, he said. In Florida there are 54 hospitals that have reached intensive care unit capacity and show zero beds available, according to data released by the Agency for Health Care Administration. Ten of those hospitals are in Miami-Dade County. Another 40 hospitals show ICUs at 10% available capacity or less, according to the agency's data. In South Texas, hospitals in Laredo are full, the city's health authority, Dr. Victor Trevino, told the city council Tuesday. A Federal Emergency Management Agency team will arrive this week to convert a hotel to a surge hospital site to treat Covid-19 patients, Interim Fire Chief and Emergency Management Coordinator Ramiro Elizondo said at the council meeting. The site will provide 106 beds and will help expand the hospital capacity for non-ICU patients, he said. Officials in Georgia said the state has 417 people with coronavirus in hospitals, over 200 more than Tuesday's total.  As the number of Covid-19 cases soar, Gov. Brian Kemp said on Twitter his state is ""working around the clock to enhance hospital bed surge capacity"" and urged residents to wear a mask and practice social distancing. Kemp has said the state will again turn the large convention center in downtown Atlanta into a potential overflow hospital. The country's most populous state set two more records Wednesday, recording highs for hospitalizations and ICU admissions. There are a total of 6,786 Covid-19 positive hospital patients and 1,907 patients in the ICU in California. The state also announced 11,126 new cases, the second most it has had.  The largest number of cases is in Los Angeles County, where the county's public health director warned another stay-at-home order might be possible.  ""We can't take anything off the table -- there's absolutely no certainty of what exactly is going to happen next,"" Dr. Barbara Ferrer said. While another stay-at-home order is ""absolutely not"" preferable, she explained it's an option that must be kept on the table if it's clear the health care system is going to be overwhelmed. ""We have to do everything we can to protect the health care system for everybody,"" Dr. Ferrer said. With Covid-19 cases   and dozens of states pulling back on reopening plans, public health experts say the end of the pandemic remains out of sight.  While New York and New Jersey were early virus hotspots, California, Florida, Arizona and Texas have become the states to watch, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor. Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, said Wednesday that ""the inevitable happened"" after the US tried to reopen and he saw ""pictures and photos and films of people at bars with no masks, congregating in crowds."" The country's ""baseline"" was around 20,000 new cases a day when reopening started. ""The problem is, since we started off our baseline so high, as we tried to open up, you saw that there was a wide variation in how that was done,"" he said. Cases started to rise, ""and now we're hanging around 60,000. That's untenable. We've got to turn that around, and that's really the issue we've got to address right now."" As of Tuesday, had been infected, and 38 states reported an increase in the number of new cases from the week before. On Wednesday, several states took steps to promote the wearing of masks. Alabama and Montana said they are required in public. The mandate from Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey is part of an amended safer-at-home order her office announced. In Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock said face coverings are mandatory in certain indoor business settings for counties with four or more active Covid-19 cases and in outdoor group settings where more than 50 people gather and social distancing is not possible.  to require all customers to wear masks. The change is set to begin next week. Walmart joins Starbucks, Best Buy and Costco in requiring shoppers to wear masks. An elementary school teacher in California's Orange County told CNN that her colleagues are extremely concerned after the county Board of Education voted this week to return children to schools without face masks or social distancing. Denise Bradford, a teacher in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, told CNN's Brianna Keilar, ""We're creatures of habit. We like our routines. We miss our kids terribly. We lay awake at night wondering if they're OK. How horrible is it that one of the things on the list to do is to have a plan for students and teachers dying?"" Bradford said teachers in her district are concerned about the possibility of becoming infected with the virus that has claimed more than 7,000 lives in California and says they cannot return to school until it is safe. Orange County Supervisor Don Wagner, who was part of the 11-person county Board of Education panel that voted for the school guidelines, told CNN he thinks face masks should be ""optional"" for children at schools and that it's a decision ""each individual school district needs to make."" Despite the vote, many of the county's 28 school districts won't adhere to the board's guidance. CNN has reached out to or reviewed information from the districts. Of the districts that responded or posted plans online -- more than half -- none said it would return children to school without masks or social distancing. Before the development of any vaccine, thousands more Americans will die from the virus, an influential model says.  The model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington is now projecting that 224,000 people will die from the virus by November 1, which is an increase of almost 16,000 from the week before.  That jump is due to skyrocketing cases around the country, particularly in Florida, Texas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, chair of the IHME Dr. Chris Murray told CNN's Don Lemon. On Wednesday, Florida reported 301,810 positive cases across the state, an increase of 10,181 cases from the previous day, according to new numbers released by the Florida Department of Health. A total of 19,334 people are currently hospitalized across the state. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Wednesday he has tested positive for Covid-19, and the state reported a record high number of new cases. Stitt attended President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa last month and was spotted in the crowd without a mask, but based on contact tracing, the Oklahoma State Department of Health says the governor did not contract coronavirus at the rally. The Oklahoma State Department of Health said Wednesday there were 22,813 total cases in the state, up 1,075 from Tuesday. The previous daily record of 993 new cases was set Tuesday. There are currently 561 people hospitalized due to the virus.  In one Texas city, the federal government is going to turn a hotel into what is called a surge hospital.

"""The two-carrier strike force trains to the highest levels of readiness to ensure responsiveness to any contingency through power projection,"" it said. The presence of the Nimitz and Reagan in the South China Sea earlier this month marked the first time two US aircraft carriers have operated together there since 2014 and only the second time since 2001. That exercise began on July 4 and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Sean Brophy aboard the Reagan said on July 8 that ""each strike group continues on its respective operational tasking."" Photos posted on the US Navy's website placed the Reagan strike group in the Indian Ocean from July 10 to July 14. China, which claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory, reacted harshly to the carriers' presence in the region in early July. ""The US action is intended to drive a wedge between countries, promote the militarization of the South China Sea, and undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the time. Since then, tensions have increased, with Washington this week labeling most of China's maritime claims in the South China Sea as illegal. ""The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire. America stands with our Southeast Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law,""  The Chinese Embassy in Washington called those accusations ""completely unjustified."" The US ""distorts the facts and international law ... exaggerates the situation in the region and attempts to sow discord between China and other littoral countries,"" the embassy said in a statement. A day after Pompeo's announcement, a US guided missile destroyer sailed near the Chinese-claimed Spratly Islands, also known as the Nansha Islands in China. The move was described as a ""freedom of navigation"" operation, part of the US Navy's commitment to asserting ""the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognized in international law by challenging the restrictions on innocent passage,"" Cmdr. Reann Mommsen, a spokesperson for the Navy's 7th Fleet, told CNN in a statement. ""Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations,"" Mommsen said. The Navy used similar language when the two carriers joined up in the South China Sea again on Friday. ""Nimitz and Reagan Carrier Strike Groups are operating in the South China Sea, wherever international law allows, to reinforce our commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, a rules based international order, and to our allies and partners in the region,"" said Rear Adm. Jim Kirk, commander, Nimitz Carrier Strike Group, said in a statement. The latest deployment was not in reaction to any of the politics of the past week, the Navy statement said. ""The presence of two carriers in the South China Sea is not in response to any specific political or world events, but is part of regular integration to exercise and develop tactical interoperability. For more than 75 years, the US Navy has been operating multiple carrier strike force operations in the region,"" the statement said. China, though, is likely to see things differently. The exercises earlier this month prompted a veiled threat to the US forces in state-sponsored Global Times, which called the US carriers ""nothing more than paper tigers on China's doorsteps"" and said Beijing has more than enough firepower to defend its positions in the South China Sea. ""The South China Sea is fully within the grasp of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), and any US aircraft carrier movement in the region is closely watched and taken aim at by the PLA, which has a wide range of anti-aircraft carrier weapons like the DF-21D and DF-26, which are both regarded as 'aircraft carrier killer' missiles,"" the Global Times report said. But Kirk said the interactions between the US carrier strike groups and the Chinese navy were routine. He said that Chinese warships monitored the US exercises, but the operations were professional and safe. ""We certainly saw the PLA Navy and they saw us,"" said Kirk. The USS Ronald and USS Nimitz carrier strikes groups, comprising more than 12,000 US military personnel among the two aircraft carriers and their escorting cruisers and destroyers, were operating in the South China Sea as of Friday, the US Pacific Fleet said in a statement. The two carriers, with more than 120 aircraft deployed between them, were conducting tactical air defense drills ""to maintain warfighting readiness and proficiency,"" the statement said.",Brad Lendon,world,"Updated 2:09 AM ET, Fri July 17, 2020 ",US Navy aircraft carriers resume rare dual exercises in the South China Sea ,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/asia/us-navy-aircraft-carriers-south-china-sea-intl-hnk-scli/index.html
"Meanwhile across India, critically ill virus patients are   from public and private hospitals for lack of beds, staff and equipment, as healthcare systems buckle under the pressure of the escalating pandemic. Bachchan's treatment threw into sharp relief India's stark wealth divide -- which the coronavirus pandemic has at times made a matter of life or death.  While more than 270 million people across India were able to climb out of poverty   2006 and 2016, the country remains one of the world's most unequal, with the top 10% of the population holding 77% of the total national wealth -- and that gap only continues to widen,   to Oxfam. As well as unequal access to healthcare, for those who live shoulder to shoulder in overcrowded urban slums --  about 74 million people --  . There is little running water or sanitation, putting them at greater risk of contacting the virus.  While India's rich can buy better healthcare and isolate more easily, with the country's borders closed and international flights mostly canceled, they too have to stay and face the crisis.   As the pandemic holds up a mirror up to society, experts say India's rich need to evaluate how the country depends on and treats informal laborers who make up the majority of the country's workforce.  Everything from employment rights, access to good education and health care and welfare is suddenly under the microscope.  About 60% of India's 1.3 billion people are considered poor, with about 21%  . They often work as unskilled or daily-wage laborers in various industries such as farming or construction. In major cities, they make up a workforce of rickshaw pullers, street and drain cleaners, vegetable sellers, delivery boys, and domestic workers.  ""Nine out of ten people are in informal work and it's not that we don't see them,"" said Harsh Mander, an Indian human rights activist and author. ""They're everywhere and yet we never look at them as human beings, we look them as labor that is available at cheap and affordable prices to make our lives comfortable.""   Because of the lockdown, for the first time many middle and upper class Indians, who rely on an army of maids, cooks, cleaners, drivers and gardeners, are having to cook their own food, clean their own houses, and take out their own trash.   ""Our reliance is huge, every household, even a middle class household, has a maid coming to clean utensils, or to wash clothes, every single day of the year,"" said Sayli Udas-Mankikar, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai. ""You can ask any Indian today and they will say I'm struggling with housework because you have never done that."" Some say the lockdown has given them a new appreciation for the domestic help they say they often took for granted.  ""I've started to realize and appreciate the privilege I have compared to others more. Especially when my area (in Delhi) was in a containment zone and I only had access to basic things like fruits and vegetables, in addition to other essentials,"" said Ankita Dasgupta, who works in public relations for a music streaming service in Mumbai.  Vedika Agarwal, founder of Chennai-based youth and education non-profit organization Yein Udaan, said the lockdowns have forced some people to open their eyes"" to the struggles of those that do the menial tasks that keep society ticking, from the street sweepers, drain and sewer cleaners, delivery boys, to those who work in their houses every day.  ""We think we know poverty simply because we interact with them or we understand their struggles because we're in close contact with them. But the lockdown and all the repercussions has shed light on the diverse struggles families actually face every single day of their lives,"" she said. On Friday, over 400 million people in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Karantaka's capital city Bengaluru re-entered lockdown conditions after a rise in Covid-19 cases.  While their employers can ride out lockdowns by watching Netflix in air-conditioned apartments or gated houses, the domestic workers struggled to socially distant in nearby informal housing or slums. Udas-Mankikar said they are mostly employed on verbal contracts and there is little to no social security available to them.  Archan Ghose, a graphic designer in New Delhi, said that some daily workers felt they couldn't isolate and continued to work, as they ""need the salaries that they get from two or three households to run their own homes and look after their family."" ""They don't have a choice, if they don't work, they don't get paid,"" Ghose said. However, not every employer has been so empathetic. Aparna Sanyal, 38, is a domestic worker from West Bengal. She supports her husband and son by cleaning and cooking in several houses in New Delhi but was forced to stop during the three-month lockdown. Because their income dried up, Sanyal said she borrowed money to pay her $73 monthly rent and $22 electricity bill for three months.  ""In the news they had said that (even if we cannot go to work during the lockdown) our employers should pay us salary, but my employers did not pay me, however, I cannot fight them,"" she said. Since her husband also lost his job, the family's income depended on her. ""My household cannot function like this without income,"" she said.  When many people like Sanyal are worrying about paying rent, Shreya Adhikari, who works as a content writer in the capital, said she is ""surprised"" that the people who have complained about the lockdown the loudest are those who are ""educated, well-read and well-informed.""  In the online game "" ,"" players assume the role of a housemaid who must make it through a 21-day lockdown, while feeding her family without running out of money -- or getting coronavirus.  Agarwal, the Chennai-based NGO founder, designed the game, with technology firm XR Labs, to give her peers empathy for the challenges facing poor families in the pandemic. So far, more than 200,000 people have played.   Decisions that have to be made include: should I use the finite water supply to clean the dishes instead of regularly washing my hands and increasing the risk of infection? Should I spend money on a Covid-19 test for a sick relative and deplete my savings, leaving my children at risk of going hungry? ""It was about giving them a voice and amplifying a voice that was not being heard,"" Agarwal said, adding that these are choices faced every day by the poor and marginalized.  She said that people don't think about ""what if a fan broke in this house, how would they survive the summer?"" During the pandemic, while the private schools had capacity to switch to online learning, Agarwal said government schools struggled to provide basic schooling. Many families couldn't afford the technology for online learning, with some not having reliable access to the internet, or even electricity. ""People didn't realize that,"" said Agarwal. ""A lot reached out and said, This is such an eye opener.""   Agarwal, who works with low-income families, said many distressed parents were anxious about where their next meal would come from, how they would pay rent without a job, all while keeping safe from the virus.  She said one woman called her scared for her life because she was locked down with her abusive, alcoholic husband who was going through withdrawal symptoms. ""The only way she thought to help was to take their lives. It was very traumatizing and I think that is an experience that a lot of women have faced,"" she said.  Srivatsan Jayasankar, co-creator of the game and co-founder and CEO of XR Labs, said the contrast was stark between those concerns and the ones his friends had -- they complained when they couldn't travel or go out to restaurants because of the lockdowns.  ""We wanted to highlight privileges that people have while staying home, their basic necessities completely taken care while a large section of the community were actually still struggling to get their basic needs met,"" Jayasankar said.  Agarwal and Jayasankar say they are amazed by the positive reaction to the game and hope that it moves people to help those less fortunate. The game includes an option to donate, and Agarwal said they have so far raised more than INR 500,000 ($6,600), which goes toward providing grocery, sanitation and educational kits to marginalized families in Tamil Nadu state.   There are still people in India who are a ""heartbeat from hunger,"" said Mander the human rights activist, and more where one illness or catastrophe can push them back into poverty.  He said the lockdown was imposed a with little thought for the nation's poor. ""When this catastrophe hit us, what was revealed was how willing we were to completely abandon them. The protections of the lockdown could never extend to the poor. To stay at home, you have to first have a home and one where you can socially distance, where you have running water and a job you can do from home,"" he said.  There are already signs the economic impacts from the pandemic are undoing some of the development India has made in recent years in alleviating poverty  according to Agarwal. She said there is evidence that a large percentage of girls in low-income houses won't go back to school because of the compounding effects of the lockdown.  ""There is so much uncertainty about how were going to bring those girls back to school when food is going to be the need of the hour and parents are not going to prioritize schooling,"" she said.  OFR's Udas-Mankikar said she believes the pandemic has ""already pushed us back a few years.""  When lockdown was announced, millions of migrant workers joined a mass exodus, leaving the cities to return to their villages, many of them on foot. Udas-Mankikar said in Mumbai, many of those who remained have not yet returned to work. ""The big question mark is what happens to them? Very often I think about what happened to the vegetable vendor who was sitting outside my house? What has happened to the woman who picks up the trash from outside my house, I wonder where she is?"" said Udas-Mankikar. ""I am really worried about the jobs, (people) can go a few months but what about after that?"" Last month, the United Nations children fund (UNICEF) said  in South Asia could be pushed into poverty due to coronavirus lockdowns and the longer-term impact of the economic crisis. Access to schools, nutrition planning, a pause in vaccination programs and heightened risk of abuse under lockdown are some of the issues that children across South Asia are facing and will continue to face in the coming months, said  . One positive that Udas-Mankikar sees is a ""larger thinking going on in peoples minds."" ""Because somewhere the value of this class is really being recognized, at least among the people who are employing them. It's gone beyond only thinking of them as people living in informal housing,"" says Udas-Mankikar. Agarwal said she's seen more people stepping up, by donating money or volunteering to relief initiatives across the country that help ensure families are fed or have access to sanitation supplies.

Dorothy Ghettuba: I am finding stories. This is the best time to find stories. What we are doing is we are betting forward. We haven't slowed down. It's been about me speaking to writers, looking at scripts, looking at stories and finding the best stories to tell out there. DG: The appetite is there. Africans are truly excited about the local content -- and not just local content, but best in class. There's a sense of pride and excitement in Africa. And when I say Africa, I truly mean it across the continent. DG: It's always going to be a reflection of the global pattern. We have seen an uptick of it and we are happy and we're excited that people are turning to us to entertain them when they're at home. DG: I think this crisis has made everybody pause and now we really have to relook at how we produce. Productions take place in pretty intimate, high-touch environments with hundreds of artists, people and creators all together in close quarters. So for us in the short term, these practices will have to be changed. DG: Can I say power cuts and load shedding and data? Those infrastructural challenges are the things that keep us up at night as an organization. And it is a big challenge across many African countries. So we're just trying to find solutions. We're trying to say, 'how can we make our services as data-effective as possible?' DG: We want to have this global catalog, so that all our members can watch our shows at the same time. That's why originals are very, very important to us. Our ultimate aim is that we want to be the home of the best-in-class African stories. We want you to know that if you're looking for the best African stories, then you will find them on Netflix. We are going to expand heavily to ensure that goal is met. DG: Our shows are broadcasting in over 190 countries. Surely that is the fastest way to export our stories and our culture to the rest of the world. It's always been, ""I have to go and I have to make it in Hollywood,"" but now you can be a superstar . Netflix is that vehicle and if you look at the stories we are telling, our culture is there.

"Across India, critically ill virus patients are being  for lack of beds, staff and equipment, as healthcare systems buckle under the pressure of the escalating pandemic.  Despite its recent economic boom, India is still a developing country, with a majority of its 1.3 billion people living in poverty. A fifth survive on less than $2 a day.  But similarly dire scenes are on display in the world's richest country, the US. In Texas,   and some patients have had to wait on stretchers for 10 hours before being examined. In Florida, a number of hospitals are  . Patients who do not require urgent care are being turned away. In Arizona,   from the heat while waiting for hours to be tested. The US is much better equipped to deal with the pandemic. It spends nearly 17% of its GDP on health care, roughly twice the average of other developed nations. It has almost six times as many beds available per 1,000 people as India. Yet its death toll is five times as high.  The system is getting stretched beyond its limits now. There were   reported across the US yesterday, topping a previous high set two days ago and pushing the total case count above 3.5 million. At least 943 people were reported dead.  ""How can you not shake your head, right?,"" Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told CNN.

However, a   has suggested that people with Type A may have a higher risk of catching Covid-19 and of developing severe symptoms. People with Type O blood have a lower risk. These study results follow evidence from past research that certain blood groups are more vulnerable to other diseases like cancer.

"Both Phase 3 trials will include Brazil and are scheduled to involve at least 14,000 Brazilians. Advanced talks are also underway to launch three more vaccine trials in the country, according to Brazilian institutes consulted by CNN.  While Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly downplayed the virus as a ""little flu"" and been criticized by experts for his unwillingness to implement forceful nationwide containment measures, the vaccine research being carried out now inside Brazil's borders could prove to be a global game changer as the northern hemisphere braces for a possible second wave in the winter.  Julio Barbosa, a 42-year-old nursing technician who has already lost five colleagues to the coronavirus, has volunteered to participate in one of the mass vaccination trials, conducted by Oxford University and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The Phase 3 trial will involve 50,000 volunteers worldwide.   After taking the shot, Barbosa says he had a low-grade fever and mild muscular pain which disappeared the next morning. In the trial, involving mostly health workers, half of the volunteers are receiving the trial Covid-19 vaccine and half are receiving a meningitis vaccine, which can provoke similar symptoms.  ""This vaccine has to come out soon so we can have a break at the hospital. I haven't stopped working in the last four months,"" he told CNN after receiving a shot at a medical warehouse erected in Sao Paulo for the trial.   Chinese biotech company Sinovac is also beginning a Phase 3 trial in Brazil, in collaboration with Brazil's Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo. Its CoronaVac trial vaccine uses inactivated virus cells to stimulate an immune response in patients. The tests will begin next Monday with 9,000 volunteers in   plus the capital.  Like the Oxford vaccine, CoronaVac will be given mostly to health professionals. Ricardo Palacios, medical director of research at Butantan, says that the institute is also in ""very advanced conversations with two other vaccines under development"" and in talks with dozens of pharmaceutical companies about Covid-19 research studies.  ""All producers in the world will always look for a place where there is high transmission to attest to the effectiveness of the vaccine. But infection rate is not enough. A country needs to have institutions that work with international scientific, regulatory, and ethical protocols to carry out the tests,"" Palacios told CNN.  Brazil is just such a place, said Natalia Pasternak, researcher at the vaccine development laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at Sao Paulo´s University (USP). She pointed out that Brazil has advanced logistics and manufacturing installations compared to many other countries with rampant Covid-19, such as Mexico.  ""It is necessary to go to a country where the disease is circulating strongly and where there are institutes and qualified professionals to carry out the tests. Brazil offers these two crucial factors,"" she said. More than 76,000 people have died in Brazil from the coronavirus, and the Pan American Health Organization has warned that case numbers in this nation of 211 million people likely  .  Preliminary results from the trials are expected to come out by the end of the year, and should help to shorten the time that vaccines in earlier stages of development will need to be developed.    The ""number one goal"" of Brazil's health system is to have the freedom to produce a vaccine, Interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello told Congress last month. ""We cannot be left out,"" he said.  As part of the agreements to host trials, Brazil expects to be able to produce both vaccines at home if they prove effective, rather than buying them abroad -- a crucial benefit for both the country and even its neighbors.    Butantan, which produced 100 million flu vaccines last year, is preparing to produce a similar number of doses for Sinovac's CoronaVac, if that vaccine proves effective.  ""To have a pre-existing structure already installed is necessary because Brazil will help to make other vaccine agreements. Latin America has few (vaccine) manufacturing plants. Brazil will need to export the vaccine to other countries after attending its public health system,"" Palacios, Butantan's medical director, said.  The Biomanguinhos complex in Rio de Janeiro, owned by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, is also preparing to produce 70 million doses of the Oxford vaccine next year, in the hopes that ongoing negotiations between the Brazilian government, Oxford and AstraZeneca will be completed by then.  Meanwhile, the results are yet to come in from the Brazilian government's own experiments with mass distribution of hydroxychloroquine. Medical trials have not proven hydroxychloroquine effective as a coronavirus treatment. Nevertheless, Brazilian mayors, doctors, and medical insurance companies continue to distribute a ""Covid kit"" -- comprised of hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin, anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, zinc, and vitamin C -- in cities in the South, Center-West, and Northeast regions of the country. With the exception of conflicting results on hydroxychloroquine, none of these treatments has been shown to help coronavirus, either alone or in combination.  Last week, after his own diagnosis with Covid-19, Bolsonaro released a video in which he praised the unproven drug, swallowing a tablet with a smile on camera. ""It is working for one more person. I trust hydroxychloroquine. What about you?"" the president said. Soon, more Brazilians may soon be recruited as test subjects for other potential coronavirus-related treatments.  The Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp), responsible for carrying out the Oxford vaccine trial that started on June 20 in Brazil, says it will soon announce a joint trial with Italy's Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute, which participated in the  .  The Italian institute is currently finishing Phase I testing of its vaccine against Covid-19. As the infection curve declined in Italy, it began looking at hard-hit Brazil as a location for Phase II and III trials, according to Unifesp's dean Soraya Smaili.   ""We hope to start it at the end of August. We will see where the infections will be more prominent in the country to make the selection of volunteers, because infections appear to be slowing in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo,"" Smaili said.  For Barbosa, the nursing technician, developing any successful vaccine in Brazil would feel like a personal victory. ""I've been dreaming about this. The first thing I would do is go to a samba and hug my friends. I would even lick the beer that drips on the counter,"" he said. Brazil, where the number of cases has now surpassed 2 million, is one of a small handful of sites for testing experimental coronavirus vaccines. It offers an unusual and appealing mix for research: a skyrocketing rate of transmission, as well as internationally respected research centers and a public health system experienced in creating and distributing vaccines.

And Ingenuity will be flying based on its own autonomy and commands that are sent in advance, rather than real-time instructions, due to the communication delay between Mars and Earth. Data from each flight will also take time to return to Earth.  The first flight and landing test is expected in spring of 2021 on Mars. But first, it has to endure the launch from Cape Canaveral at the end of this month, the journey through space to Mars and landing on Mars.  Then, it has to detach from the underside of the rover and use its autonomy to make the best decisions on how to keep itself warm at night and how to keep itself charged by using its solar panel. And finally, Ingenuity will experience its first flight, well within the view of the Perseverance rover and its cameras that will hopefully be able to track and watch the flight.  ""Perseverance should be able to image the helicopter while it's flying from a safe standoff distance, about 50 to 100 meters out, and use its cameras to zoom in,"" said Matt Wallace, Perseverance deputy project manager at JPL, during a recent press conference. ""Whether the helicopter will see vehicle depends on its orientation and how high it goes."" Based on that flight experience, the Ingenuity team can attempt as many as four other test flights within a 31-day window.  If Ingenuity's technology demonstration is successful, it could pave the way for more advanced robotic aircraft to be used on future missions to Mars, both robotic and human, according to NASA.  While Martian orbiters allow for global vantage points and make communication possible with Earth, and rovers show detailed views of the ground, aircraft on the planet could contribute unique and helpful observations. This could aid robots and humans on Mars and even access areas where rovers can't go. ""The Ingenuity team has done everything to test the helicopter on Earth, and we are looking forward to flying our experiment in the real environment at Mars,"" said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity's project manager at JPL, in a statement. ""We'll be learning all along the way, and it will be the ultimate reward for our team to be able to add another dimension to the way we explore other worlds in the future."" The helicopter's name was submitted by high school student of Northport, Alabama, during a contest to name the aircraft and selected by NASA.  ""The ingenuity and brilliance of people working hard to overcome the challenges of interplanetary travel are what allow us all to experience the wonders of space exploration,"" Rupani wrote. ""Ingenuity is what allows people to accomplish amazing things."" Although development of the rover began 10 years ago, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena began working on the design for a lightweight aircraft that could fly on Mars in 2014. Testing of a succession of models continued up through January 2019, when the design passed its final tests.  Ingenuity is an incredibly lightweight design, weighing only 4 pounds and featuring four carbon-fiber blades, solar cells and batteries. The blades are divided among two rotors spinning opposite of each other. Ingenuity's rotors will spin much faster than the helicopters we have on Earth.

"Elsewhere in the region, some countries have seen the numbers stabilize, whereas conflict areas -- Yemen, Syria and Libya -- continue to grapple with limited testing capabilities.  Experts say floundering health care systems, information suppression, delayed government responses and premature reopenings contributed to the region's deepening crisis.  ""Most countries (in the Middle East) with the exception of Iran, did well in the beginning. In May, countries across the region scaled back their lockdown measures,"" Dr. Rick Brennan, the World Health Organization's regional emergency director, told CNN on Wednesday.   ""Due to economic or social pressures, the easing of restrictions coincided with Ramadan causing an increase in mobility. The worry now lies with the reopening of international travel more than local transmission."" In Iraq, the pandemic has exposed gaps in a medical infrastructure decimated by decades of sanctions, war and corruption.  A doctor and coronavirus patient simultaneously, Iraqi anesthesiology specialist Dr. Alaa Hussein al-Talaqani says health authorities need urgently to ramp up their responses. Talaqani says he tested positive on June 19. ""I am very afraid about the possibility of transmission of the virus to my family and to other people ... because I am sure that it is difficult to control the viral outbreak in Iraq due to lack of simplest protective measures, due to the government default,"" he told CNN.  ""It is the responsibility of the Ministry of health and the Babylon Health Directorate to do what they could but they cannot do everything due to political corruption,"" he said. Iraq has repeatedly said it is trying to crack down on corruption. At Iraq's largest cemetery in Najaf, graveyard workers say they're receiving up to 80 bodies a day.  Neighboring Iran crossed the 245,000-case mark last week after its highest official daily death toll since the start of the virus outbreak. Iran was the first country in the region to witness an outbreak, but the spread began to slow in May. The resurgence of the virus in recent weeks comes two months after the country began to loosen its lockdown.  Out of over 264,500 cases, more than 13,400 people have died,  That's a 5% mortality rate, one of the highest in the world.  In early July, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani urged the public to come forward with their symptoms, calling it a ""religious duty."" ""Unfortunately, we see that some consider being infected with the virus bad and hide it. If someone knows that they have been infected with coronavirus, they have a religious and human duty to inform others about it,"" Rouhani said in a statement published on the official Iranian presidency website.  Saudi Arabia has seen a big spike in cases since June, despite launching some of the earliest and most aggressive measures to stop the spread. It has reported over 240,000 cases and more than 2,300 fatalities -- a much lower death rate than Iran. According to Brennan, ramped up testing in the kingdom contributed to its rise in reported cases.  The oil exporting giant is also the destination of Islam's most important pilgrimage, the Hajj, forcing the kingdom to curb religious rituals. It canceled what is known as the ""smaller pilgrimage"" -- Umrah -- early in the outbreak. It is hosting  this year with limited numbers: It normally hosts 2 million pilgrims, but this year only 1,000, exclusively domestic, Muslims will attend.  Egypt's confirmed cases almost doubled in June: from 32,612 cases in the first week to 63,923 cases by the end of the month, according to WHO, though since the start of July In July, the daily rise in cases appears to have dropped.  Almost every day, the Egyptian Medical Syndicate publishes photos of dead health care workers with the words, ""May God have mercy on their soul"" in Arabic. Health care workers describe the situation as desperate, and complain of a shortage of protective equipment.  At least 117 frontline workers have died from the virus and more than 400 have tested positive since the outbreak began in Egypt in mid-February, according to the doctors' group. But Amnesty International says the number could be much higher.  ""This number does not include doctors who died with Covid-19 symptoms, such as pneumonia, who did not undertake the PCR tests,"" Amnesty reported last month. ""It also excludes the death toll of nurses, dentists, pharmacists, technicians, delivery workers, cleaning staff and other essential workers who are also on the front line and have risked their health and well-being to ensure that people are able to access health care and other essential services.""  The fear of detention is exacerbating an already difficult situation for workers on the front lines in Egypt. Those who complain about the government's response or the medical infrastructure can be held on charges of ""spreading false news"" or even ""terrorism,"" the Amnesty report said.  ""Health care workers in Egypt have been arrested, criminalized and prosecuted simply for daring to express their personal safety concerns and, in some cases, have been denied access to adequate health care,"" Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement.  The Egyptian government has not responded to CNN's request for comment about these claims.  In some countries, coronavirus is complicated by conflict. Yemen, Syria and Libya all effectively have multiple governments, all of whom are cash-strapped. In Yemen, the effects of Covid-19 hav brought the   In Syria and Libya, the hodgepodge of political forces has created logistical challenges for the supply of PPE, test-kits and ventilators.  Syria's rebel-held Idlib, battered by years of war, also saw its first recorded cases of the virus in the past several weeks. ""Aid workers have feared the appearance of coronavirus in northwest Syria for months,"" said Kieren Barnes, Mercy Corps Country Director for Syria, said in a statement last week. ""The millions who live in this region are often residing in close quarters, may not have enough clean water for drinking and handwashing, and frequently lack the necessary resources to protect themselves."" In crisis-ridden Lebanon, Covid-19 cases are on the rise months after a relatively successful government-imposed lockdown. Prominent health professionals warn of hospitals' limited capabilities to field large numbers of infectious cases as the health sector grapples with major cash shortages and power cuts.  In  , the social media account for the doctors' union resembles an obituary page -- more than 100 health workers have died from the virus. In Iraq, frustration is mounting over the flailing health sector as cases skyrocket.  In Iran, considered the regional epicenter of the pandemic, Covid-19 deaths have soared again after the initial surge several months ago subsided. And   one of the Arab world's richest countries, is not far behind its regional arch-rival in terms of total cases, despite having a population less than half its size.

"Mr. Eazi says one of his primary motivations for funding music  is to provide financial support for artists to expand their catalog.  Many investors and financial institutions don't understand the business of music and as a result, are unable to properly fund musicians, he says.  ""Artists cannot go to banks to get money for their music because financial institutions don't understand how to secure intellectual property. They get it for physical properties but not for music. So, because not a lot of people understand the music business, there is no finance product for musicians,"" he explained. Selected artists will be given funding depending on their revenue and projected incomes, using metrics such as streaming revenue, Mr. Eazi told CNN. ""For artists who already have footprints in the industry, we will just do our research. We can check how much they are earning or likely to earn from their streaming revenue, for example,"" he explained.  Artists will be given funds upfront based on their revenue to expand their music content. The initial advance invested in an artist's music will be paid back in installments as the artist's earnings start to rise, he added. Mr. Eazi, who has more than  monthly listeners on Spotify says the AMF will also create access to a larger audience for music acts by helping them find and book shows as well as distribute their music.  ""Let's say we have a two-year contract with someone. In those two years, we will be their representative, helping them manage their music, and as they grow we will be deducting the initial investment from their earnings,"" he explained.  Mr. Eazi says his parent company emPawa Africa in partnership with music technology company   will be launching Cinch Distro, a music distribution platform for new artists.  Through Cinch Distro, artists can upload one song to major music stores for 500 naira (about $1.19), or 4000 naira (about $10) for unlimited song uploads.  ""The way it works is that they register on the platform and make their music. It has an AI-based tech that will filter their possible revenue based on the number of streams they get on the platform alongside a couple of other metrics,"" he said. ""The artists basically use the platform to distribute their music and we monitor their progress. That way we can make data-backed decisions about who to invest in,"" he added.  The AMF is not Mr. Eazi's first venture into investing in music and musicians on the continent.  In 2018, he launched  , an incubator program that provided artists with funding and resources to market their music, access radio and TV airplay, and train them to become independent music entrepreneurs. Through emPawa, some of the continent's biggest artists like Nigeria's Joeboy and Ghana's   were  .  Music analyst, Toye Sokunbi says the AMF fund will benefit Africa's creative sector as it will open more doors for music talents on the continent.  Sokunbi, who is also the founder of  , a pop-culture publication in Nigeria, says there may be concerns about how the data on each artist is compiled and used and warns artists to be vigilant.  ""Many artists don't have the same accessibility to important data that music distributors have about their music. They don't necessarily tell you the exact way they are marketing your music or give artists access to data they can use to maximize revenue for their content. This information imbalance means artists are largely oblivious of much of the audience data farmed from their content,"" he told CNN. According to him, it is important for artists to have access to their own data from the backend so that they can build their own music communities and become less dependent on distribution companies.  However, Mr. Eazi says all artists he funds will have access to information about their content and earning in real-time. ""With our tech platform you can see how much you earn in real-time, you can also see how much you owe and how that is being deducted,"" he said. Additionally, Mr. Eazi says he wants to contribute to creating a music industry where Africans are the owners of their own content and intellectual property.  The biggest players in the African music industry are not from Africa, he said. As a result, he wants to create a space for music stars on the continent to become a significant part of the industry.  ""I want to look back and be fulfilled knowing that I contributed to getting African equity participation in the music infrastructure that has been built on the continent.""  Mr. Eazi, (real name Oluwatosin Ajibade) told CNN that the Africa Music Fund (AMF), is worth $20 million dollars. The lead investor is  , a company that provides capital for African businesses.

"Much of the world's population, especially in poorer nations, worry about getting hold of the vaccine at all. But even if a coronavirus vaccine were cheap and easy to get, one third of Americans and 47% of Republicans told   that they would not try to get vaccinated. Could that have changed now that the virus is raging in southern, conservative states and confounding Donald Trump's misinformation about its potency? And given that the Trump administration has botched almost every aspect of the pandemic response so far, there's little reason to think it can handle the complex, ethical, regulatory, medical and societal issues that will come with a vaccine -- even if Americans did want it.

"""This personal touch is missing,"" said Laura Dudley, an associate clinical professor at Northeastern University and expert in behavior analysis and body language. ""We're hungering for that human interaction, that friendliness, so we're starting to do things like waving to say goodbye. It feels a little nicer than just clicking off.""  In person, there are subtle (and not-so-subtle) social cues, such as closing a notebook, checking your watch, putting things in a bag or getting ready to stand up, that show an interaction is winding down. But those same signals don't translate on video calls, so experts say people are trying new behaviors that better suit virtual communication, such as waving and smiling, even in an otherwise professional setting.  ""People are overperforming social cues of closure because X-ing out a window on your computer is so much more ambiguous than standing up, walking out of a room, or doing other signaling for in person terminations of meetings,"" said Melanie Brewster, associate professor of counseling psychology at Columbia University.

Even if diners are eager to go out, restaurants have to reduce their capacities and keep people far enough apart to satisfy social distancing rules.  Meanwhile, their costs are soaring. Restaurant operators have to pay for personal protective equipment for workers, lots of hand sanitizer, paper towels, contact-free payment systems and more. They may have to pay to  . And the cost of some ingredients,  , is way up.  Reducing menus could help. And, at least for now, customers don't seem to mind.  Restaurants already operate with very thin margins, so it's difficult for them to absorb costs without making any changes.  One obvious way to cope with higher costs is by passing them on to customers via higher prices. But diners won't stand for it.  ""What restaurants really hate is adding fees and doing things that frustrate the customer,""  said Sean Kennedy, the National Restaurant Association's Executive Vice President for Public Affairs. If customers see prices go up, they may turn to a competitor. Or they might just eat at home.  ""There's a lot of options outside of restaurant meals,"" said Tim Powell, a managing principal of Foodservice IP, a foodservice consulting firm. ""If you start raising prices it means that there's a good chance that demand, or the traffic, will go down.""  While some restaurants have reportedly started adding so-called Covid surcharges to bills,   from April to May, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Shrinking the menu is a better option. It allows restaurants to order ingredients in bulk and achieve better economies of scale. And because restaurants remove their least popular or more expensive items, the changes may impact a relatively small number of customers.  At Dave & Buster's for example, ""the 15 items we selected generate a significant portion of our food revenue,"" CEO Jenkins explained. Even before the pandemic hit, restaurants would sometimes trim their menus to reduce costs or increase efficiencies. ""We tend to go in and out of those phases,"" said Powell, the food consultant. Last year,   and abandoned its   to help speed up its service and make its menus less complex.  And while some customers may miss seeing their favorite dish on the menu, others may be happy with — or at least tolerant of — the changes.  At McDonald's, the newly reduced menu has improved customer satisfaction scores ""significantly,"" said Mark Salebra, chair of the McDonald's National Franchisee Leadership Alliance in a statement provided by a company spokesperson.  Plus, some diners may not care that much about variety right now.  Denny's ""customers have been extremely understanding of the adjustments we've made,"" said Dillon, adding ""we've found our guests are appreciative of the focus we have been putting on safety, cleanliness and sanitation that a slightly smaller menu enables.""   IHOP's Haley put it this way: ""we're not seeing complaints from guests."" The industry has been hit hard by efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19. From March to May, eating and drinking place sales were $94 billion below expected levels, according to a   by the National Restaurant Association. Reopening will be difficult as well. The slimmer menus are a way to shed complexities and costs, and push simpler or more popular items at a time when conserving cash is crucial for restaurant operators. ","Danielle Wiener-Bronner,CNN Business",business,"Updated 8:20 AM ET, Wed June 24, 2020 ",Restaurant menus are getting smaller. Here's what some big chains are dropping,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/23/business/restaurant-menus-shrinking/index.html
"After the third robbery, Dukes started bringing a gun to work. Then, in October 2019, the fourth robbery happened. According to the local prosecutor's office, a man entered the store with a gun and demanded money from the cashier. When Dukes tried to intervene, the man — Roosevelt Rappley, just 23 years old — pointed his gun at Dukes. Then Dukes pulled out his own gun and shot Rappley, killing him.   A grand jury in Ohio reviewed the case and found Dukes ""acted lawfully under the circumstances,"" according to the prosecutor's office. But by then Dukes was out of a job, allegedly having been fired by Dollar General for violating company policy. Dollar General's 2019 policy said that possession of a firearm on the company premises may result in termination. Dollar General declined to say why Dukes was terminated, saying in an email that it does not comment publicly on specific employment situations. The company said it does not retaliate ""against employees who make good faith reports of safety concerns."" It also maintains that the safety of its employees is a top priority. Rappley's family is still trying to process his death eight months after the robbery. Rappley's sister Jasmine Jessery said in an interview that she didn't hold a grudge toward Dukes. ""He was protecting himself,"" she said.   Jessery described her brother as a kind person who had linked up with the wrong crowd. ""Everything went sour"" then, she said.  Business is booming at Dollar General, the chain adding more stores every year than any other retailer in America. That was the case even before the coronavirus pandemic, but Dollar General has been in an even stronger position during the pandemic as price-conscious consumers stock up on essential items. Dollar General has kept its stores open since the coronavirus hit, and  since the beginning of the year even as the S&P 500 has lost 5%. In March, the company announced a goal of  to meet increased customer demand.  Former executives, store employees, law enforcement officials and retail security experts told CNN Business that while the company's low-cost, no-frills model might be embraced by Wall Street, it is putting its workers at risk.  Dollar General stores, which process a high number of cash transactions, are a prime target for armed robberies, they said. Some of the former company officials and current and former employees spoke on the condition of anonymity either to discuss internal conversations or for fear that speaking out would impact their jobs.  ""Every night I was just waiting for there to be a phone call that said, 'Hey we've lost somebody,'"" Brian Flannery, who oversaw security at around 2,000 Dollar General stores in the northeast as a divisional loss prevention director from 2011 to 2015, said. ""It wasn't a matter there [of] if you were going to have a bad robbery. It was a matter of when."" At least six Dollar General employees have died during robberies since 2016, according to a review of news and police reports. And while the FBI doesn't specifically track robberies at dollar stores as it does those which occur at convenience stores and gas stations — other robbery targets — police have warned company managers that its stores are vulnerable.    In a statement in response to this story, Dollar General said, ""We employ a number of measures designed to create and maintain a safe work environment for our employees and a safe shopping environment for our customers, all while protecting company assets.""   The company said its safety and security measures take federal and state laws, retail industry standards and law enforcement recommendations into account and its measures are ""designed to prevent, deter and if necessary, respond to criminal activity in our stores.""  ""Our employees are our greatest asset. Their safety and security is of paramount importance,"" Dollar General added. The problem of robberies isn't exclusive to Dollar General. In an interview with CNN Business, Jason Hall, a lieutenant with the Dayton Police Department, described local dollar stores as ""robbery magnets."" He has tracked robberies at local chains including Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar General over the last few years — and Dollar General, by far, had the most incidents. In Dayton alone, police were called to 86 robberies at just seven Dollar General stores between 2016 and 2019. Robberies at Dollar General locations accounted for 29% of the 80 commercial robberies in the city in 2019, according to figures provided by the department.  Dollar General declined to comment on how much it spends annually on crime prevention or any specific measures in its stores to protect workers and prevent robberies ""as to do so potentially compromises the integrity of those measures, provides a roadmap to would-be wrongdoers and may place customers and employees at risk."" As other retailers have struggled in recent years, dollar stores have enjoyed breakneck growth. The Great Recession, slow wage growth and widening inequality in America had all boosted discount retailers. Now the pandemic is as well.  The two largest players are Dollar General and Dollar Tree, which   Family Dollar in 2015.  There are a few differences between the chains. At Dollar Tree, for example, all items are  . The stores tend to be in middle-class suburban areas.  Dollar General's more than 16,000 stores, on the other hand, sell items largely in the $1 to $10 range, meaning there is more cash in registers. That makes stores more susceptible to robberies, according to retail security experts.   Dollar General stores are predominantly located in rural areas. About 75% of its stores are in towns with  . Todd Vasos, the company's CEO, has described his core customers as  . Dollar General's primary customers make   per household.  ""We do very good in good times and we do fabulous in bad times,"" Vasos said on a call with Wall Street analysts in May. ""We're very, very bullish on what post-Covid looks like because...I think we're very well positioned no matter what this economy does to both our core customer and to the customer overall.""  Investors like Dollar General because it's been relentless at making more with less: less real estate, less labor and smaller product sizes than its larger big-box competitors. In its latest fiscal year, Walmart's US stores had a 5.1% operating profit margin before taxes; Dollar General stores boasted an   — an indicator that Dollar General is more efficient at keeping costs low and turning sales into profits.   Since  , Dollar General's   have increased five-fold and its stock has surged more than 800%. Its locations have nearly doubled, and now the chain boasts more US stores than Walmart, Kroger, Costco and Home Depot combined. A record 25,000 retail stores are expected to close this year, but Dollar General still plans to open  , or roughly 20 new stores a week.  But the company's low-cost approach often comes at the expense of employees, former executives said. Efforts to keep costs down have also kept the company's leadership from wanting to take bigger steps on security, these executives said. Visibility inside the stores is often poor for workers because of the design, according to law enforcement officials. Stores tend to be small and crowded, with high shelves and piles of boxes and carts lining the aisles. Some police patrolling outside complain that it's difficult to see inside because windows are covered with advertisements and signs.   Dollar General said in an email that ""we continually review and, as needed, adapt operating procedures and store layout [and] fixturing.""  Staffing is intentionally kept at a minimum, often with just one or two low-wage employees on site at any given time, former executives said. And although store registers are often flush with cash because it's what many customers use to pay, security guards are rarely on the premises.  Security guards were viewed as costly to the company's bottom line, the former executives also said.   One former Dollar General executive described the difficulty in convincing other company leaders that security guards could deliver a positive return on investment. ""We certainly didn't get a return having somebody standing there and paying $10 or $12 an hour,"" the former executive said. ""Out of the 13,000 stores when I was there, probably less than 100 stores had some type of outside security.""   Another of the former Dollar General executives, who focused on security, said he was ""heavily chastised"" for frequently going over budget on monthly guard expenses.  Adding staff to stores would have also jeopardized the low-cost model.  ""It's a low margin business, so you have to have low labor [costs] to make a profit,"" said one of the former executives. ""Putting more labor in the stores took away from the profit, or you have to raise prices. And there was no appetite to raise prices because it's a low-price business.""   The company has invested in interactive security monitoring services. At thousands of stores in higher-crime neighborhoods or that have experienced frequent incidents, cameras are monitored by offsite security agents. The agents can communicate with employees in the store and make public announcements over the loudspeakers letting customers know they are on camera.  If the agents see a robbery or suspicious activity at the store, they can alert the local police. There are also two-way phones and panic buttons that employees can press to talk directly with a security agent if they are in distress.  Interface Security Systems, one of the services that Dollar General uses, boasts on its website that its technology helps companies   by 88%. Dollar General also has used iVerify, another off-site monitoring company. Earlier this year, Securitas Electronic Security acquired the customer contracts of iVerify.  The remote monitoring systems can be effective at deterring shoplifting inside the store, according to experts. But unlike human security guards who can act as a visible, physical deterrent, they are less effective at deterring robberies, according to police, former employees at iVerify and Interface, and retail security consultants.  One former iVerify executive said, ""it's rare that you're going to be looking at a video when the robbery occurs."" He said the remote monitoring was better-suited for investigating robberies after they occurred.   Securitas, the company that now owns iVerify's customer contracts, did not respond to request for comment. A representative for Interface said ""there is a place for both remote interactive monitoring and security guards in most retail chains"" and that its interactive remote monitoring systems with live video and two-way audio were a strong crime deterrent.  When robberies do occur, some of the former Dollar General executives said, the company offered reactive, short-term measures — such as adding a security guard to a store for a few weeks.   ""It was literally whack-a-mole. You would get the okay to spend cash when there was an incident. A reactive security program in that kind of environment is not what you're looking for,"" said Flannery, the former divisional loss prevention director at Dollar General.   Dollar General said it disagreed with Flannery's characterization of its security efforts and that it doesn't believe ""those assertions are supported by facts.""  The safety concerns take a toll on some workers. When Kenya Slaughter works the cash register at a Dollar General in Alexandria, Louisiana, she makes sure she has enough $1 and $10 bills in the drawer, so she won't have to go back into the safe. When she has to take out money from the safe behind the register, she ""strategically positions herself"" so she's not opening it with her back turned.  Still, potential robbers ""know we don't have security and that people are in there alone,"" she said.  Indeed, Dollar General employees told   in a report last month that they've been stabbed, shot and held at gunpoint.   In recent years, Dollar General has focused on solving another problem.  Current and former staffers said there was an intense urgency to combat ""shrink"" — or merchandise lost due to shoplifting, employee theft or inventory errors. In its  , Dollar General called the problem ""significant,"" noting that ""higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.""  The sources said they felt that the company prioritized reducing ""shrink"" over preventing robberies, which had a human toll.  ""In the two years I sat in the executive meetings, I never remember anybody bringing up armed robberies as a problem. We talked about loss of product and store manager turnover,"" said one former top Dollar General executive. ""The people that are below the store manager level are just a commodity.""   The obsession with reducing shrink was often turned inward, with Dollar General treating some of its own workers with constant suspicion, said Tracy Vargas, an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. Vargas worked as a clerk at Dollar General in 2014 and 2015 for her   on dollar stores at Syracuse University. She also interviewed 50 employees from across the country. In her dissertation, she described workers being treated like criminals with surveillance cameras often focused on their activities rather than on customers.   Dollar General said its ""understanding is that Ms. Vargas's employment with the company was intended solely to validate her preconceived notions regarding the company for purposes of a book that she was writing, rather than in furtherance of serving the customers and communities that rely on us.""  It added: ""We categorically deny the assertions.""  A 13-foot poster in the store backroom, known as the Shrink Chart, displayed performance statistics including the number of times each employee voided cash register transactions that week, Vargas said. (A large number of voided transactions or price checks could be interpreted by managers as a sign of employee theft.)   Meanwhile, Dollar General provides little training on how to handle robberies, sources told CNN Business.  Former store workers, including Dukes and Vargas, described when they were first hired being shown a simulation video of a robbery. There are no hands-on drills and they did not have to review the video annually, some of these sources said. In some stores, signs are posted in back rooms giving employees directions on what to do ""should the unlikely event of robbery occur.""   Vargas told CNN Business that Dollar General employees are ""sitting ducks"" and ""considered to be profit risks to the corporation's bottom line.""   ""Employees are alone, exposed, and at the mercy of whomever [decides] to walk through the door that day,"" she said. In some cities, local officials have urged Dollar General management to take more steps to prevent violent crime. They say their warnings have largely gone ignored. Dayton police have prepared reports on crime at local Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. On February 1, 2017, members of the department presented a Dollar General divisional loss prevention director with a 32-slide PowerPoint deck detailing the factors the department believes to be ""enabling factors"" in robberies. The factors included blocked windows, high shelves, lack of maintenance outside the stores and lack of security guards in high-incident locations.   It's a ""fairly large issue for us,"" Hall, the Dayton Police Department lieutenant, told CNN Business. ""We've made a lot of recommendations to try to improve these situations. We have noticed that not many of these recommendations have been implemented or fully implemented.""  Dollar General said it ""enjoys frequent communication with the Dayton Police Department"" and that it implemented the department's exterior maintenance suggestions in 2017. The company claimed the department did not provide ""specific store safety and security measures."" A representative for Dollar Tree, which owns Family Dollar, said ""working with and supporting local law enforcement is absolutely important to us. We continually refine our security program, which includes cooperating with local police departments to share photos and videos to support their investigations."" In St. Louis, where there have been ""high calls for police service for larcenies, disturbances [and] hold-ups"" at Dollar General and Family Dollar in recent years, ""implementing security is often suggested and ignored,"" said Rich Sykora, an attorney for the city of St. Louis.  ""We will take a fresh look at the St. Louis market and implement the appropriate steps,"" a Dollar Tree representative responded. In rural Effingham County, Georgia, Sheriff Jimmy McDuffie said three of the five Dollar General stores in the area have been hit in recent years. ""We don't call them dollar stores. We call them stop and robs,"" he said.   McDuffie presented a list of safety concerns to Dollar General stores in the county, he said, including recommendations to improve lighting and limit the number of boxes piled up inside the stores, which can make it difficult for officers to see inside. ""Put in some security measures,"" he urged. ""Light the parking lots up.""   ""They say they're going to do better, but it doesn't seem to come to fruition,"" he told CNN Business.   And in the Pee Dee region of South Carolina, there have been a string of robberies at Dollar General stores over the past year.  ""None of the stores have added outside cameras that could potentially capture the mode of transportation and the direction of travel for suspects,"" said Tammy Erwin, a deputy at the Marion County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina. ""There are no security officers at any time. There are shifts with only one employee working in the entire store,"" she said. She added that she wonders why Dollar General won't implement ""a buddy-system of employees, so that no one is alone in the store.""   Dollar General's 2019 handbook of operating procedures says ""at a minimum, two employees must be involved in the closing process. For safety purposes, always use the buddy system."" But there is no mention of similar policy for opening stores in the morning or at other hours of the day. The company says it ""tries to minimize the time that employees are alone in the store.""  The company said it has received ""no formal safety and security policy change"" from the sheriff's offices in Effingham County, Georgia, and Marion County, South Carolina.  Dollar General said it was ""aware of a single request from a member of law enforcement in St. Louis,"" who requested that Dollar General implement facial recognition software from a company ""in which we understood the individual to have a personal and financial interest.""    Family members of Dollar General employees killed during armed robberies and security experts say it's not just a lack of in-store security measures that are the problem.   Out of the six Dollar General employees killed since 2016, two were shot as they left stores to deposit cash from the register at the bank.   Some Dollar General employees take cash deposits to the bank by themselves: The company's policy in its 2019 store operating procedures says that stores should make one or two such deposits each day depending on their location, and that the deposits can only be made by ""key carriers,"" or high-ranking employees.    took a job as a store manager at a Dollar General in Richmond, Virginia, and hoped to work his way up the ranks at the company and become a district manager. But he was killed in his car outside of Dollar General one morning after picking up a cash deposit from the store, according to the  . His case is still unsolved.   In Houston, 20-year-old   was killed in 2017 as he got in his car to bring cash from the store to the bank. His mother, Janine, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. The case has gone to arbitration.  Janine Anderson described her son in an interview as ""an all-around good kid"" who was active in his church and developed a love of photography in high school. He saved up money to buy a camera and equipment and took it everywhere he went.     ""He always was going to have some type of career in art,"" she said. ""That was his passion.""  Before his death, DeQuan had raised concerns about the bank-drop process on multiple occasions, the lawsuit said. But despite previous robberies at the store, Dollar General did not increase its security or hire an outside security company to transport cash to the bank, the lawsuit alleges.    Dollar General declined to comment on pending litigation.   Meanwhile, Dukes, the former Dollar General employee in Dayton, Ohio, is trying to bounce back after the October robbery that changed his life. He has had trouble finding work after the shooting. He is hoping to be more present in his kids' lives.  ""I don't regret anything that I did,"" he said. He was defending himself, he said. But Dukes believes the robbery could have been avoided if Dollar General had taken his advice and put in permanent armed security. He hopes company executives will start doing more to protect their employees.  ""They don't know what's going on inside these stores every day. They don't. Store managers are the ones that deal with that every day. But I would tell them that they need to take better care of their staff.""  After each of them, Dukes, 28, would say later, he'd asked his supervisors at Dollar General to put in a security guard.  But, according to Dukes, his bosses didn't do that — though, because of how many robberies he'd been through, they did start sending him out to train employees at other stores.","CNN Business,CNN Business",business,"Updated 12:24 PM ET, Fri June 26, 2020","Dollar General is cheap, popular and spreading across America.

"But last year the Segway PT accounted for only 1.5% of Ninebot's revenue, according to Tony Ho, vice president of global business development at Segway. With a price tag starting at $6,000 and sometimes reaching $10,000, only police departments and tour groups could afford it, he said. ""It was a great invention 20 years ago,"" said Ho.

The price tag was a major barrier to adoption, coming in at $4,950 when it was first released. Batteries, which initially cost more than $1,000, were too expensive to make a more affordable version. For years, the company struggled to reduce the price. Prices actually increased, likely due to inflation and new off-roading features, according to Ho.

Starhopper's successful run came one day after a hop attempt was   three seconds after the Raptor engine fired up. The craft never left the ground, and stray flames appeared to shoot out from the top of the vehicle, but no serious damage was done. Musk said the hop test was called off because the fuel was ""colder than expected,"" causing an issue with pressure levels inside the vehicle. Starhopper is designed to be an early precursor to a deep-space exploration rocket called Starship, and Musk has said rapid development of the technology is a top priority for SpaceX. The latest design for Starship, which was earlier referred to as BFR, show it riding into orbit atop the most powerful rocket booster ever built. SpaceX hopes to use the launch system to deliver massive loads of satellites into orbit, and eventually to shuttle humans out into the solar system to explore and colonize Mars.

The company has also created more novel experiences; a VR performance by British singer Emeli Sandé displays two images of her simultaneously, one playing the piano and the other singing.  This year, MelodyVR plans to begin offering live streaming via a paid-for virtual ticket, and has designed its own cameras for the task. ""We needed to create [VR cameras] that wouldn't get in the way of the production, but can also survive the variety of elements that could come with a musical performance, whether that is artists jumping around right next to the camera, champagne [being sprayed on them], or fireworks right in front of them,"" Steven Hancock, co-founder of MelodyVR, told CNN Business.

For comparison, the global games market was worth around  , according to market intelligence firm Newzoo. But some analysts see a brighter future. Scott Buchholz, Deloitte's emerging tech research director, told CNN Business that ""[The VR market] is likely to continue to grow, particularly as we see an increasing convergence of AR and VR gear, as well as prices continuing to drop and capabilities continuing to rise,""  MelodyVR says it will release its own VR headset this year, for use with its phone app. Priced at around $20, as with other smartphone headsets on the market, the user's phone will act as the screen and speaker.  Hancock dismissed suggestions that live VR concerts could mean fans will no longer travel to actual performances. ""If (someone can) go to a show (they) always will,"" he said. ""But for all of the limiting factors as to why people can't get to live shows, be it geographical restrictions, age restrictions, or cost ... we realized there might be an opportunity to smash all those barriers and truly globalize music."" In the last few years, musicians have been able to stream concerts to virtual reality headsets, allowing fans to enjoy the virtual spectacle from the comfort of their homes.

The R2 is also classified as a low-speed vehicle so it doesn't have to meet the same safety requirements as cars and SUVs. Low-speed vehicles can only go as fast as 25 miles per hour and must not weigh more than 2,500 pounds. Nuro is required to report any crash-related information to the federal government and to periodically report general information about the R2's operation. A spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation declined to offer additional details on what other data must be provided. ""One will need to look at the fine print of the reporting requirements to fully assess if NHTSA will be requiring robust enough information on adverse events to fully quantify the risks and benefits of the deployments,"" said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist in the MIT AgeLab and the associate director of the New England University Transportation Center at MIT. ""I'm glad to see that this is only for low speed deployments as one needs to walk before anyone is allowed to run."" Initially, the R2 will be followed by a vehicle with a human driver who will monitor it and intervene remotely if needed. The R2 is already being tested on private land. Nuro plans to build only a few hundred R2s in its first year and will remain focused on Houston for the time being. It expects to produce thousands more vehicles once it releases its next-generation R3. The company did not say when it plans to release the R3.  Unlike most self-driving companies, Nuro is focused on carrying goods rather than people. There are fewer safety and ethical questions when an autonomous vehicle is carrying groceries than a human being. Such questions as to whether a pedestrian or a passenger should be prioritized in a crash can be avoided. Most self-driving companies have not applied for government exemptions as they continue to develop and alter their vehicles. Companies offering self-driving rides today, such as  , are relying on vehicles that include traditional car components, including steering wheel, pedals and mirrors, which have given them a quicker path to deployment. Nuro, based in Mountain View, California, is now able to launch up to 5,000 of its R2 autonomous vehicles over the next two years, according to the US Department of Transportation. The R2 has no steering wheel, pedals or side mirrors as it's designed to be unmanned and carry cargo.

"Elon Musk's younger brother,  , who was named ""Global Social Entrepreneur"" of the year by the World Economic Forum in 2017, started Square Roots, an indoor urban farming company based in Brooklyn, in 2016. Square Roots' mission is to bring fresh, local food to cities around the world by empowering younger generations to participate in urban farming. ""When I was a kid, the only way I could get my family to sit down and connect was by cooking the meal,"" Musk, co-founder and executive chairman of Square Roots, told CNN Business in an email. ""Getting involved with the internet, especially in the late 90's, was very exciting and I wouldn't change anything about those experiences, but my passion has always been food,"" Musk said. ""The moment Elon and I sold Zip2, our first internet company, I knew I wanted to pursue food and become a trained chef."" He moved to New York and enrolled at the International Culinary Center. Musk said the company plans to open a Square Roots ""Super Farm"" — with 25 climate-controlled shipping containers, cold storage, biosecurity infrastructure and everything else needed to run a vertical farm at scale — in less than three months. Since its inception, Square Roots has grown more than 120 varieties of crops, including greens, vegetables and strawberries. The company isn't the first of its kind. Startups like Silicon Valley's Plenty, which was founded in 2013 and is backed by Jeff Bezos, are also beginning to dominate the space. ""Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts, among others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way to salvage a food-scarce, ultra-urbanized future,"" Kheir Al-Kodmany, a professor of sustainable urban design at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in a report. It involves various techniques, such as hydroponics, which uses mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent; aquaponics, which uses aquatic creatures -- such as fish and snails -- and cultivates plants in water; and aeroponics, which grows plants in the air.  As for job creation, rapid climate change will put millions of traditional farmers out of business, but vertical farmers won't be affected, according to microbiologist Dickson Despommier, an emeritus professor of public and environmental health at Columbia University. Although vertical farming was first introduced in the early 1900s, it was recently popularized by Despommier. More than 20 years ago, he began teaching a class at Columbia called Medical Ecology.  Despommier spent a decade growing crops indoors with his students. ""Ten years ago, there were no vertical farms,"" he said, noting that LED grow lights have vastly improved farming efficiency over the last five years, making indoor growing cheaper and more reliable. ""People want local food because they've lost trust in the industrial food system that ships in high calorie, low nutrient food from thousands of miles away with little transparency as to who grew the food and how,"" said Peggs, the Square Roots CEO.  At the same time, the world population is growing and urbanizing rapidly. Peggs said climate change is threatening existing supplies of food, forcing the industry to figure out new ways to grow food quickly. Peggs is optimistic about raising money for vertical farming. ""A lot of smart money and capital is entering the space,"" he said. ""The quality of food that can now be produced in these indoor systems is at least on par with the best organic field grown food you can buy."" Despommier said that cities will eventually be able to grow ""all they can eat"" from indoor farms located within city limits. ""If an outdoor farm fails, the farmer has to wait until next year to start again, he said. ""Indoor farms fail too, but the indoor farmer can start again within weeks."" Vertical farming is an   in which crops are grown in stacked layers, often without soil. The practice is becoming more popular and important as urban populations grow dramatically and available farmland decreases. While vertical farming isn't a new concept, these eco-friendly indoor farms are now rapidly expanding.","Alexis Benveniste,CNN Business",business,"Updated 1:17 PM ET, Fri February 28, 2020 ",Elon Musk's brother wants to transform farming,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/musk-vertical-farm/index.html
"Simpson had bought a 3D printer for the lab in 2017. He hoped to use it to build custom parts that kept organisms alive inside of the NMR spectrometer for his research. But the commercial resin he needed for high-quality light projection 3D printing (where light is used to form a solid) of those parts was expensive.  The dominant material for light projection printing is liquid plastic, which can cost upward of $500 a liter, according to Simpson. Simpson closely analyzed the resin and spotted a connection. The molecules making up the commercial plastic resin were similar to fats found in ordinary cooking oil.  ""The thought came to us. Could we use cooking oil and turn it into resin for 3D printing?"" Simpson said. What came next was the hardest part of the two-year experiment for Simpson and his team of 10 students -- getting a large sample batch of used cooking oil. ""We reached out to all of the fast-food restaurants around us. They all said no,"" said Simpson.  Except for    . In the summer of 2017, the students went to a McDonald's location near the campus in Toronto, Ontario, that had agreed to give them 10 liters of waste oil.  Back in the lab, the oil was filtered to take out chunks of food particles. Rajshree Ghosh Biswas is a second year PhD student working in Simpson's lab. She joined the team that was experimenting on McDonald's cooking oil in the summer of 2018. She was tasked with synthesizing small batches of the oil to try to convert it into high-quality resin.  Each time the resin was produced it was used to 3D print a butterfly. The breakthrough came in September.  The team successfully printed a high-quality butterfly with details as minute as 100 micrometers in size. ""We did analysis on the butterfly. It felt rubbery to touch, with a waxy surface that repelled water,"" said Simpson. He described the butterfly as  ""structurally stable."" It didn't break apart and held up at room temperature. ""We thought you could possibly 3D print anything you like with the oil,"" he said. The experiment yielded a commercially viable resin that Simpson estimates could be sourced as cheaply as 30 cents a liter of waste oil. Simpson was equally excited about another benefit of the butterfly the team had created.""The butterfly is essentially made from fat, which means it is biodegradable,"" he said.  To test this, he buried a sample butterfly in soil and found that 20% of it disappeared in a two-week period. ""The concept of sustainability has been underplayed in 3D printing,"" said Tim Greene, a research director for global research firm IDC who specializes in the 3D printing market. ""The melted plastic currently being used as resin is not so great for the environment."" ""This is also a great way to reuse and recycle waste cooking oil,"" said Ghosh Biswas. Terri Toms, the McDonald's franchisee who gave the oil to the students, agreed. ""I was impressed by the research initiative and happy to contribute to something that could possibly be helpful to future generations,"" said Toms. Simpson's team is no longer getting oil from McDonald's, but it hopes the research gets noticed by the industry. Simpson and his team published their  in December 2019 in industry publication ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. In it, they wrote that ""every year, it costs millions of dollars for fast food restaurants to process waste, including waste cooking oil. ""Most recycled waste cooking oil is currently used in the production of soap and biodiesel. It may be transformative for recycling programs if high-value commodities [such as resin]can be manufactured directly from it,"" the paper said. McDonald's has taken note.  Leanna Rizzi, a spokeswoman for McDonald's Canada, said the company learned about the outcome of the experiment, which it called ""a great initiative, when the research was published last month. Rizzi said the world's largest fast-food chain has a global sustainability program called "" ,"" which includes initiatives to tackle plastic pollution and its used cooking oil. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Portugal, McDonald's  for use in its own delivery trucks. Simpson is director of the school's Environmental NMR Center dedicated to environmental research. Central to this research is an analytical tool called the NMR spectrometer. NMR stands for nuclear magnetic resonance and is technically similar to how an MRI works for medical diagnostics. ""We use the NMR spectrometers to look inside tiny living organisms and understand their biochemical response to their changing environment,"" said Simpson. The overarching aim is to ""help bridge the gap between medical research and the environment.""","Parija Kavilanz,CNN Business",business,"Updated 10:22 AM ET, Thu February 20, 2020 ",A new use for McDonald's used cooking oil: 3D printing,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/19/business/mcdonalds-oil-3d-printing/index.html

LightSail 2 boarded its long-awaited flight to space in June, secured alongside two dozen other payloads on a  . The satellite reached its intended orbit and, on June 23, it unfurled razor-thin sheets of polyester to form a 32-square-meter sail.  After some trial and error, LightSail 2 was able to maneuver its sail to harness photons' momentum, which offered a ""tiny push no stronger than the weight of a paperclip"" each time the spacecraft lapped Earth, according to the Planetary Society.  The gentle nudges added up. In just a few days, LightSail 2's distance from Earth grew by about 1.7 km, or about one mile, said project manager David Spencer.

LightSail 2 does not, however, have any obvious business applications. But the 50,000 backers who put money into the project aren't expecting to get a dime back, Vaughn said.

The NASA astronauts have spent their days conducting   to upgrade the space station's hardware as well as handling scientific experiments designed for the microgravity environment on board the station. They've also shared images snapped from a viewing module aboard the space station, which has orbited the Earth and hosted astronaut crews from all over the world for two decades.  The United States is one of the space station's primary operators, but the country hasn't had the ability to launch its own astronauts to the ISS since the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011. Since then, NASA's astronauts have had to travel to Russia and train on the country's Soyuz spacecraft on seats that have cost up to $90 million each. SpaceX worked for a decade to develop its own replacement for the Shuttle under a $2.6 billion fixed-priced contract with NASA. Though largely funded by taxpayers, SpaceX designed and owns its Crew Dragon capsules and the associated Falcon 9 rockets they fly aboard. NASA will serve as SpaceX's customer, purchasing seats for astronauts as needed, and allow the company to sign up its own passengers, including tourists, scientists and even   for future missions. The journey Behnken and Hurley began in May won't be considered a success until they return safely to Earth. And the voyage home will be just as perilous as the ride to orbit. Weather permitting, the astronauts will board their Crew Dragon spacecraft on August 1 and spend one day slowly descending toward Earth. The next day, the capsule will slice back through the Earth's thick atmosphere and deploy parachutes to cushion their landing in the Atlantic ocean.  If done successfully, SpaceX's Crew Dragon vehicle could be officially certified for human spaceflight missions. (Behnken and Hurley's trip is considered a test flight.) NASA's decision to set a target return date is a sign that SpaceX is on track to have a second Crew Dragon ready to fly the first operational crewed mission, dubbed Crew-1, this fall.

"""It's been a lot of comparing notes, people refreshing their memories and trying to piece together how this happened,"" said one of the people involved in the discussions. ""It included some security people that tend to be the most creative in thinking of, 'Well, if I were the bad actor, how would I do this?'"" Their analysis could help to address some of the many unanswered questions that still remain two days after the attack unfolded. Twitter has outlined in broad strokes a sophisticated and coordinated ""social engineering"" attack on its workforce that the hacker or hackers launched in order to "" "" of the accounts. In a  , this type of hack could have led to false market-moving tweets, fake declarations of war or nuclear attacks, or even misinformation that could change the course of an election — or worse.  Twitter declined to comment for this story. So far, the company has revealed some important clues. It   hackers targeted workers who had administrative privileges. Once a number of them had been compromised, the hackers used their access to internal controls to send out tweets promoting a Bitcoin scam under accounts owned by Bill Gates, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West, Warren Buffett, and others. On Friday, the New York Times  , citing interviews with people involved in the events, that the hack was the work of a group of young people who opportunistically leveraged their access to the tool. But that still doesn't explain how the hackers could take control of the accounts. And a person close to the Biden campaign told CNN Thursday that Twitter has not shared much more with victims of the attack than it has released to the public. Based on Twitter's preliminary explanation and the circulating screenshots, the former employees quickly concluded that hackers had accessed an administrative platform known internally as ""agent tools"" or the ""Twitter Services UI."" This internal tool is intended for employees to handle customer support requests and to moderate content, said a person familiar with Twitter's security.  Hundreds of Twitter employees have access to agent tools, according to one of the people who participated in the former-employee discussions. It is a powerful platform that can show Twitter users' cellphone numbers if they have registered them with the company, as well as users' geolocation and any IP addresses that have been used to access the account, the person said.  Ashkan Soltani, a security expert and former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission, said it's not unusual for tech companies to have internal tools such as these. While the exact features and permissions might differ from company to company, he said, the bigger question concerns the scope of the compromised employees' access.  ""The question at the end of the day is, 'What level of [employee] account was accessed?'"" Soltani said. ""And if it was a lower-level account, is Twitter doing anything to properly segment it from [employee] superuser rights?""  One of the most sensitive capabilities associated with Twitter's tool is the ability to change the email addresses to which Twitter sends password-reset instructions. What likely occurred, the former employees said, is that the attackers used the tool to change the email addresses associated with the targeted Twitter accounts, then sent password-reset instructions to new email addresses under the hackers' control. Once the hackers were able to alter the user passwords, they could log into the Twitter accounts as if they were the rightful owners. The attack could have happened right under the noses of the people whose accounts were taken over. Many social media companies have built their user login systems to be frictionless, meaning that consumers are rarely logged out of an app after they change their passwords.  ""So if you are a celebrity, someone using this method could have changed your password but you wouldn't necessarily be locked out and you wouldn't necessarily know about it,"" said a former employee.  In other words, the hacked users could have been looking at their Twitter accounts as if nothing had changed. In principle, security techniques such as two-factor authentication are meant to thwart unauthorized logins. An account protected by two-factor authentication will ask users to provide not only a correct username and password, but also a verification code sent to a separate device that a legitimate user would control. In this case, any two-factor authentication on the victims' accounts could have been bypassed, the former employees said. One of agent tools' capabilities is the power to disable two-factor authentication, one of the people said. (According to Soltani, this type of capability, along with the power to change user email addresses, is often used by companies to help customers recover their accounts if they lose access to their cellphones or email.)  If the former employees' theory is correct, then all the hackers needed to do in taking over these prominent accounts was to disable two-factor authentication if it was enabled, change the destination address for password resets, then surreptitiously change the victims' passwords and log in with the new credentials.  There are some things agent tools do not allow, according to one of the people: The platform does not directly grant access to the contents of users' direct messages, for example. But by logging in to an account as the rightful owner, a hacker would still be able to access those messages. Twitter has said there is no evidence passwords were stolen, but it is   whether ""non-public data"" may have been compromised. The person close to the Biden campaign said that in the case of Biden's account, there are no compromising messages to be found. ""I've seen the DMs over there, and it's nothing special,"" the person said. ""It's all just outreach to voters."" While the nature of the attack is becoming clearer, what remains a mystery is how the hackers gained access to agent tools in the first place.  Twitter has blamed the security incident on ""coordinated social engineering,"" a term that Michael Coates, a former chief information security officer for Twitter, said could encompass a range of threats.  ""This could be any number of techniques being used, from phishing emails [to] some sort of bribery,"" he   on CNN's ""Quest Means Business.""  The company faced a bribery scandal last year when federal prosecutors   of spying for Saudi Arabia. At the time, Twitter said it ""limits access to sensitive account information to a limited group of trained and vetted employees."" Access to agent tools is limited by a number of safeguards, the former employees said.  ""I can confirm there are many layers of controls,"" Coates said, speaking of Twitter's internal systems broadly. ""There's analysis, there's logging, data science analysis, minimum privilege — all these things that you would expect in these systems."" At least two other layers of protection are involved, according to the former employees. Under normal circumstances, agent tools can only be accessed while employees are connected to the company intranet — meaning they must be physically in the office or logged into the network via VPN. And to log into agent tools itself, the employees must provide their own corporate username and password.  It's unclear whether the pandemic may have led to remote work policies that could have made it easier to log into agent tools, several former employees said. While it is a possibility, they acknowledged, there is no evidence that Twitter relaxed its security to accommodate working from home. Twitter declined to comment on its remote work policies. Even within agent tools, employees' roles within the company can limit which user accounts they may access, one of the former employees said. For example, a person whose job is to handle support requests from journalists may be able to access journalist accounts, but perhaps not others. These limitations may help explain why the hackers targeted a wide range of current Twitter employees. Due to the activity records that Twitter keeps on its employees, tracking down which worker accounts accessed the accounts of VIPs would be a trivial task, the former employees said. A more difficult challenge — one that would likely require the help of law enforcement — would be determining whether the employees themselves were knowingly involved, or if they were simply used as unwitting accomplices by the outside hackers.  Investigators have also not ruled out the possibility of nation-state involvement in the attack, though at the moment there does not appear to be evidence of it, according to a person familiar with the matter. They are not the only ones searching for answers. So are members of Congress, cybersecurity experts, and Twitter itself. The FBI is involved, too: Officials said Thursday they are investigating the incident, and law enforcement sources have told CNN the agency is reviewing what appear to be screenshots of Twitter's internal account management software circulating on social media.  The former employees' analysis focuses on the same software, a powerful tool that gives a significant number of authorized Twitter workers the ability to manage high-profile accounts, including by viewing protected user information and even changing email addresses linked to the accounts, according to interviews with several former employees, all of whom spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss a former employer. The former employees concluded that hackers likely used the tool to access the accounts and then reset passwords.","Brian Fung,CNN Business",business,"Updated 7:07 PM ET, Fri July 17, 2020 ",How the massive Twitter hack may have happened,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/tech/former-twitter-employees-sleuthing/index.html
"""I knew it was my time in my life to give back to the people who paved life's path for me to have the 45 years of life that I've had,"" she told CNN.  Brenner, who moved to Gig Harbor, Washington, about six years ago, was furloughed from work at a menswear store after Covid-19 hit. She quickly realized that she is not very good at sitting around.  She said she decided she wanted to help elderly members of her community and those who could not get out and shop for themselves because of the pandemic.  So, she signed up to work as a shopper for Instacart. She only spent two days working with the grocery delivery app -- but during that time she noticed one item her customers kept asking for: frozen lasagna. One of those customers was a man in his nineties. Brenner said when she delivered the frozen lasagna and other items to him, he confessed to her that he had not had any fresh food in nearly a month and a half.  That moment inspired Brenner to do some grocery shopping of her own, and pick up the ingredients to make her family a fresh lasagna based on her grandmother's recipe. ""Frozen lasagna is not a treat,"" she said. ""I am not a fan of frozen lasagna. I'm very Italian."" After her dish came out of the oven, Brenner jumped on Facebook to do what so many others have done throughout quarantine: Share her home cooked meal on social media. In her post, Brenner  offered to make her lasagna and deliver it free of charge to anyone who wanted one.  When she received enough requests, she went to the store and spent her $1,200 stimulus check on ingredients and started cooking.  She made more than 130 lasagnas, and distributed them to those who requested it for free.  ""The whole point of this is to spread that sense of community wherever we can through the comfort of lasagna,"" she said. ""So, I don't want anybody to feel disincluded because reality is there are people out there who can't afford a dollar."" This is a one-woman operation. Brenner spends eight to 14 hours per day doing all the cooking herself. She spent the last 90 days working without a day off.  ""Many of us go to work and want to go home right away... and I never had that feeling,"" she said of her recent cooking endeavor.  Brenner started the operation in her own home, pushing her kitchen to its limit and setting up a contactless food pantry in her front yard.  Recently, she said she was given free use of a commercial kitchen at the Gig Harbor Sportsman's club, allowing her to grow her operation. The process of distributing the lasagnas has allowed Brenner to see the impact of her work first hand.  One family, she said, cried when she arrived on Easter because without the lasagna and other treats, they told her they did not have enough money to celebrate the holiday this year. Another man Brenner fed told her he had recently lost both his father and young son to Covid-19. One woman told Brenner she donated lasagna to the nurses taking care of her mother in an Alzheimer's ward. Brenner said she feels her lasagna delivers more than just nutrition: It creates an opportunity for family members to bond. ""That's a family meal, that's time to sit together, that's memories making, that's conversations,"" she said. ""It's something you'll remember the rest of your life."" Although she distributes the lasagnas for free, many in her community wanted to chip in. They decided to organize a series of fundraisers online to help Brenner keep the operation going. Over the last nine weeks, Brenner said they raised more than $23,000 for her -- which translated into 1,275 pans of lasagna. While Brenner does not know what will happen when her furlough ends, she said she does not plan to stop making lasagna for others. She called the experience of making lasagna for her community ""a dream come true.""  ""People say 'are you tired?'"" Brenner said, ""and I go, 'you know, I don't have time to think about that, I have lasagna to make.'"" So far, she has made more than 1,275 pans of lasagna for friends, neighbors, first responders, and anyone in need of a good fresh meal -- without charging anyone.  For Brenner, this is a labor of love, and she has no plans to stop.","By Gabriel Kinder, CNN",world,"Updated 8:07 AM ET, Fri June 26, 2020 ","Furloughed from her job, she's now the 'Lasagna Lady' who cooks free meals for first responders and friends",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/26/us/coronavirus-lasagna-lady-food-donations-trnd/index.html
"""Without [Apollo], I don't think the computer revolution would have happened as quickly and on the same trajectory,"" Hero told CNN Business. ""It would have taken an extra 10 or 20 years."" NASA's Apollo program was the first-ever ""moonshot."" And the ingredients that led to its success were a whatever-it-takes attitude, loose management structures, and deep funding.  Kennedy estimated early on that the first moon landing would cost about $7 billion to $9 billion. But the first thing James E. Webb did when he became NASA's administrator in 1961 was tell Kennedy to double that amount. It was a move ""any venture capitalist who has funded a high-tech startup would understand,"" Hero writes in ""The Mission of a Lifetime."" The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is insisting they can launch their companies on the cheap, Hero said. They can end up low-balling their way out of business. Congress was the Apollo program's financial backer, writing big checks year after year. Lawmakers even authorized NASA in 1962 to offer ""supergrade"" salaries so that the space agency could afford to hire the best and brightest, Hero notes in his book. But, NASA could not lumber along as a bureaucratic regime if it wanted to blast humans to the moon in less than 10 years. Enter  . He left a prestigious career at research groups such as Bell Labs to lead NASA's human spaceflight program in 1963. The space agency's history office   him as ""a no-nonsense, forward-thinking leader"" who ""introduced a remarkable series of management changes."" Mueller created a ""flat organization"" structure: He cut out middle management and ""made sure that the engineers on the front line were able to get their concerns straight up to the top people of NASA,"" Hero said. If safety concerns were raised or an idea just wasn't working out, decision makers listened and quickly shifted course. ""They really did trust people in the lower levels, and the engineers benefited from that,"" Hero said. Today, California's hive of startups and tech giants, from   to  , still  the same management technique. ""Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them,""       in its widely influential workplace culture manifesto. ""We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix — giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions."" Apollo managers also had no problem bringing in young visionaries to take on unprecedented tasks, a move emulated by Silicon Valley and its obsession with young minds thinking outside the box. Mission Control in Houston, Texas, for example, was an operation that had no precursor, and no one knew how to run it. So its manager, Christopher Kraft, brought in a bunch of ambitious 20-somethings. The average age of Mission Control employees during the Apollo 11 moon landing was just 26, Hero notes. In terms of computing power, a modern cellphone could outdo the entire Apollo spacecraft, physicist Michio Kaku wrote in a 2011  . The digital revolution that followed Apollo was no accident. Microsoft's Bill Gates and Apple's Steve Jobs built off   that NASA incubated during the Apollo era, Hero said. Some of the tech titans that dominate today's headlines credit NASA and Apollo as a source of inspiration, and a few have Apollo-like ambitions of their own. Elon Musk, who made a fortune off     and now runs     and SpaceX, declared that he will relentlessly pursue the goal of reviving deep-space exploration technologies with  . Jeff Bezos, the multibillionaire behind    , has brought up the moon landing as a source of inspiration in numerous interviews and public speeches. He's personally funding his own space venture,  , that hopes to be instrumental in returning  President John F. Kennedy's iconic 1962 speech, directing the United States to put boots on the moon within the decade, set in motion a leap in innovation. In just seven years, America went from lagging the Soviet Union in space technology to planting a flag on the lunar surface.

At one point, Bon Jovi's wife, Dorothea, took a picture of him washing dishes for social media. It was captioned, ""Do what you can.""  The caption inspired him to pen a song and ask fans around the world to do their part as well.

"A lot has changed since then. The coronavirus has ripped through the global economy, hitting India particularly hard. India's diplomatic spat with China has spilled over into tech, aligning it with the Trump administration's own distrust of Chinese companies. And while India has always been a big draw for US tech firms, the   for tech cooperation with China and   in places such as Hong Kong are giving new importance to the Indian market.  But the flood of investment also highlights something that has now been true for years: India's digital economy, with more than 700 million internet users and roughly half a billion yet to come online, is simply   for Big Tech to ignore for long. ""People have confidence that, long term, India is going to be a good market, that long term, its regulations are going to be fair and transparent enough,"" said Jay Gullish, who heads tech policy at the advocacy group US-India Business Council. ""I think these are just ... deepening roots that already exist.""  Silicon Valley has been largely shut out of China for years, thanks in part to the country's massive censorship mechanism dubbed the Great Firewall. And a controversial new national security law imposed in Hong Kong, where Google and Facebook's services are still accessible due to its relatively unfettered internet, could  .  The law gives Hong Kong authorities sweeping power to regulate tech platforms, including ordering them to take down posts that threaten China's national security or restricting access to their services. Facebook, Google and Twitter have said they will   with the Hong Kong government, while TikTok has   completely.  ""It is harder and harder to do business with China,"" said Mark Lemley, director of Stanford University's program in law, science and technology. ""There is also a growing sense that doing business with China involves troubling moral compromises."" US distrust of Chinese tech  . President Donald Trump last week claimed credit for thwarting the expansion plans of Chinese tech company Huawei, and his administration has said it is ""looking at"" banning hugely popular short-form video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance.  It's a step that would only further align the US with India. The Indian government   last month, after a border clash between the two countries that left 20 Indian soldiers dead led to calls for a boycott of Chinese products. And though India's tech relationship with China   — Chinese smartphones dominate the Indian market, and most of India's biggest startups have sizable Chinese investment — the recent tensions could strengthen India's longstanding tech ties with the US.  ""India and its Southeast Asian neighbors have tried to balance the two powers by forging greater economic ties with China while holding on to the security umbrella provided by the United States,"" said Ravi Shankar Chaturvedi, research director at Tufts University's Institute for Business in the Global Context. ""China, through recent actions, has effectively delivered the US to India for a generation."" Chaturvedi and other experts point out that India and the US have had a longstanding tech relationship, with thousands of Indian engineers working across Silicon Valley and Indians currently at the helm of Google, Microsoft and  .  ""There's natural synergy between India and the United States in the digital realm,"" said Gullish, adding that the boost to internet usage from Indian households socializing and working more from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic may further enhance India's appeal as a market. ""It's easy for American companies to look to India for opportunities,"" he said.  At the same time that US tech companies were eying India's market, Asia's wealthiest man appeared to position himself as a willing gatekeeper. Most of the tech investment into India this year — including   and   — has gone into the coffers of companies controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Jio Platforms, the digital subsidiary of Ambani's conglomerate Reliance, has raised more than $20 billion since late April from companies,   and   looking to use it as a quick conduit to India's massive digital economy.  Jio launched as a mobile network in 2016 and has quickly amassed nearly 400 million subscribers. With recent forays into e-commerce, digital payments, streaming services and even a Zoom-like video conference platform called  , Ambani appears to be looking to turn the company into an all-encompassing Indian ecosystem.  And Silicon Valley clearly wants in.  ""US tech hasn't been able to penetrate the 'Great Firewall of China' but it has been easier for it to enter the 'Great Paywall of India' created by Jio; all it had to do was pay Reliance the toll fees to enter,"" said Chaturvedi.  As one of India's biggest companies run by the country's richest man, Reliance has an enormous amount of local influence and is unencumbered by many of the regulations on data storage and e-commerce that have been roadblocks for Facebook, Google and Amazon. ""No global entrant could have managed this as successfully and as quickly on their own as Reliance has,"" Chaturvedi said. ""Much of the ecommerce regulation and data localization laws have been influenced by Reliance."" As the Trump administration increasingly  , Silicon Valley will look afield to expand its reach, according to Lemley. And India is ripe for the picking.  ""Much as it pains me to say it, the US isn't nearly as attractive a place for innovation as it was five years ago,"" Lemley said. ""As the Trump administration makes it harder and harder to bring the best and brightest people from around the world to Silicon Valley, I think tech companies may be looking towards a world where we are no longer the center of innovation.""      in January,       nearly $6 billion in late April and     topped them all last week with a   commitment. They're part of a wave of investment into India's tech industry this year that's now well over $20 billion, with most of it coming from the United States.

"RR Auction has become a destination for a cohort of space fans with disposable income who are obsessed with preserving (and monetizing) pieces of NASA history. The auction house started as a small dealer focused on historical manuscripts and autographs. In recent years, it's hosted the sale of some of the most valuable pieces of spaceflight history, including the watch astronaut Dave Scott wore during the 1971 Apollo 15 Moon landing, which   in 2015. Many of the objects that have passed through RR Auction's listings were secretly stowed away for decades after the Apollo program ended in 1972. Unbeknownst to the public, early NASA astronauts frequently defied orders by saving pieces of hardware and take them home as keepsakes.  ""NASA knew they were doing this, but it caused a ruckus,"" Bobby Livingston, RR Auction's executive vice president of public relations, said.   NASA sued astronaut Edgar Mitchell in 2011 for attempting to auction off a video camera he'd taken with him during his 1971 Moon mission, as documented by journalist and space historian  . Mitchell lost the case and was forced to hand the camera over to the US government. In 2012, however, Congress passed a   that granted Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo crew members ownership over their keepsakes. That created a thriving spaceflight memorabilia market, Livingston said. And RR Auction zeroed in, signing up astronauts and longtime collectors to use their platform to trade artifacts. It's a small but competitive and sophisticated market, he added, and RR Auctions caters to it by hosting bi-annual space-focused sales. ""Most of the people that that purchase these things are engineers and in to computers and the internet and now have disposable income,"" he said. ""They're fascinated by men walking on the Moon."" Jurvetson, the SpaceX investor and board member with a  , has been building his space artifact collection for about 11 years, he said. The offices of his investment firm, Future Ventures, serve as his personal museum. Glass display cases are full of pieces of spacecraft hardware. It's even furnished with a couch made from an Apollo Command Module and a rocket tail fashioned into a table.  ""My intent is to find the right kind of display where the most people can see it,"" Jurvetson said. ""Every major museum has the majority of its artifacts in storage."" Based on the number of entrepreneurs and other visitors his office typically sees, Jurvetson said he estimates that if his exhibit were a space museum, it would rank in the top 10 nationally in terms of foot traffic. This week, he chose to sell off a few items — including the Apollo 15 flag and a spoon that astronaut Edgar Mitchell used during the Apollo 14 mission, which sold for $25,000 — because he was running out of room for his collectibles. But he purchased a few items too, he said, including meteorites he hopes he can squeeze onto his offices' shelves. Unlike some collectors, Jurvetson, 53, said he didn't grow up as a collector or even an avid space fan. He said he developed that passion because of SpaceX, the Elon Musk venture credited with ushering in the commercialization of space. Jurvetson was one of Musk's earliest backers. But collecting space artifacts is not all about the passion, Jurvetson said. They're also an investment. ""I try to acquire things that I think are the right price,"" he said. ""And I will tell you that in 10 years, they've definitely gone up in value."" This week's auction, which ended Thursday night, sold items from about 45 collectors, including Steve Jurvetson, the SpaceX and     board member and Silicon Valley investor. In all, 288 items sold for $690,000.

"Record-low rates have led to increased demand among homebuyers, according to Freddie Mac.  But the mortgage giant warns that the rise in new virus cases is stalling the the economic recovery, and this pause risks turning temporary layoffs into permanent job losses. That could negatively impact home buying. The record low rates have come amid a roller coaster of optimism and pessimism about the economy, said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. ""On the downside, an escalating number of coronavirus cases in a growing number of states demonstrate how hard the virus is to contain, especially when trying to jump-start the economy,"" she said. ""On the upside, signs of progress toward a coronavirus vaccine give hope that there's a path to a new normal where health concerns don't dominate decision making.""   This week, concerns about the economy have helped to push mortgage rates lower. Meanwhile, the opportunity created by lower mortgage rates is driving up home buying, and pushing up new mortgage applications from a year ago, she said.  Rates that are more than 80 basis points below last year's level mean financing the typical home is $125 less per month versus the same-priced home at last year's rates, she said.  ""This is opening doors for many homebuyers, even as the number of homes available for sale dwindles,"" Hale said.

"Andy Sommer, who owns a lifestyle boutique store called Forth and Nomad in a high-end Houston shopping district, is one year into a 10-year lease, which costs him $16,000 a month. Sommer said he has a good relationship with his landlord, who has told him to pay what he can for now and they'd figure out how to make up the difference later. But, in April and May, he couldn't afford to pay anything.  Sommer was able to pay three-quarters of his rent for June and July -- thanks to money from his   loan and some revenue from his store's online site. Going forward, though, he doesn't know how much he'll be able to pay, especially given that Houston may soon  .  With so much beyond his control, he, like a lot of small business owners, wonders how much he should have to pony up. ""Should we be responsible for rent when we're forced to close by the government? Should it be on us or on the landlord? It's nobody's fault but whose responsibility is it?"" Aleta Williams, a chef who founded her own catering company in Chicago called Loquacious Culinary Events, only pays $700 a month to sublet a commercial kitchen she shares with the lease holder and can write off a portion of her residential rent, since she uses part of her home for her business. But given that bookings at her catering company -- which relies on large gatherings -- have mostly dried up, she's been having trouble even affording that amount.  She paid April and May rents in full, she said, thanks to a short-term contract she had to provide food at a college that still had international students on campus. And she paid her June rent in full, plus half of her July rent, thanks to a few other small gigs and the PPP loan she received.   But she hasn't paid herself since this all started and has been living off personal savings, which are dwindling. Williams said so far the building owner has told her and the person she sublets from to pay what they can. ""We've been fortunate. I know so many who don't have landlords with that same compassion,"" she said. An informal survey taken at the end of June by small business advocacy group The Main Street Alliance found that nearly 60% of its members had delayed or reduced their commercial rent payments in the past four months. Nearly half said they've had to pay business expenses by borrowing against their home or using their personal credit cards.  In New York City, a   set up to help small business owners during the pandemic has handled 850 cases so far. Of those, more than half have pertained to commercial leasing matters, said Akira Arroyo, the clinic's director.  Gerry Reilly located his bar, Lizzie King's Parlor, just a few blocks from the Barclays Center, a popular sports and entertainment arena in Brooklyn. But it's been closed for several months and it's unclear when it will reopen. Since the pandemic, Reilly has transitioned his bar to takeout and now has outdoor seating, but business is a fraction of what it used to be, he said. ""When we signed the lease a huge part of the business plan was the events at Barclays. Bars rely on crowds,"" Reilly said. His current rent, including taxes and utilities, comes to about $7,000 a month. He said he's a little behind now and is trying to strike a deal with his landlord. His latest offer is to pay half his rent for the next two years.  As Reilly sees it, if he leaves his landlord won't be able to find a new tenant quickly given the downturn and he would collect no rent for some time.  The economic strain likely will get worse before it gets better for everyone. ""That's why we recommend landlords keep tenants at any cost,"" said James Famularo, President of Meridian Retail Leasing, which brokers leases of retail and restaurant spaces in New York. He's seen dozens of small businesses break their leases in recent weeks. But he's also seen all manner of deals being struck. They include a few months of rent abatement or rent forbearance. Sometimes a business owner may agree to pay the landlord a fixed percentage (e.g. 15%) of whatever revenue her business generates in the coming months. Or a tenant signing or re-upping a lease may get six to eight months of free rent, plus another 12 months at half the normal rent.  If landlords can't or won't negotiate a deal, ""it will be a chain reaction that trickles up,"" Famularo said. Landlords will have a hard time finding new tenants if they kick out the old ones and that will make it even tougher for them to pay the mortgages they hold on their commercial properties. Right now, concessions are being made by many lenders, especially for borrowers whose loans were performing well before the pandemic, said Mike Flood, the senior vice president of commercial/multifamily policy at the Mortgage Bankers Association. Typical forms of relief that landlords can receive from banks include forbearance for a few months, interest-only mortgage payments, loan restructuring or letting them tap the cash reserves they are required to keep to cover property costs, Flood said. But until the United States gets a much better handle on the coronavirus, local economies will be hobbled. The longer recovery takes, the harder it may become for landlords to get concessions that let them offer the breaks their small business tenants need to survive.

"While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.  Even now, as more frequent ""king tides"" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.  ""Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago,"" says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. ""The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now."" The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets. Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.  Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet. But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.  They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.  ""They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!"" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. ""We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude."" Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis. ""If you sell your home in Little Haiti, you think that you're making a big deal, and it's only after you sell, and then you realize, 'Oh, I cannot buy anywhere else.'"" After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil. Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.  They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. ""This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti,"" she says. ""Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide."" She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June. ""The area we took was all industrial,"" says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. ""There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.  ""Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them.""  He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti. But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. ""Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways,"" she says with a resigned head shake. ""Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government."" ""(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring,"" Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. ""But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet."" Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms. ""We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties,"" he says. But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.  What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of  , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.  Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently. And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. ""Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,"" Alston wrote last month.

"The main reason for America sliding in the rankings is poor marks for Washington's political commitment and regulatory stance towards clean energy and fossil fuels.   President Donald Trump has attempted to  by slashing  and installing a  to lead the EPA. At the same time, Trump has gutted fuel economy standards and    ""The United States has remained flat, while other countries have evolved,"" said David Victor, a professor at the University of California San Diego who sits on the panel of advisors that ranks nations on the energy transition.  Experts warned that the coronavirus pandemic adds great uncertainty to future efforts to transition the world to cleaner energy.  The health crisis has scrambled intricate global supply chains, making it harder for solar companies to source panels they normally buy from China. And plunging revenue in cities and states and at major companies could make it harder to fund the transition towards renewable energy.   ""Pre-pandemic, market forces were pointing in the direction of substantial new investments in renewables. But the pandemic has put a big shock into this,"" said Victor.   The World Economic Forum report called out the United States and other leading energy consumers such as Australia, China and Russia for failing to adopt zero-emissions goals.  ""The weakening of fuel economy standards in the United States raise concerns over the level of political commitment to the energy transition,"" the report said.   Yet that's progress has been made, particularly at the state level.  More than half of the 50 US states have   that require a certain percentage of electricity come from renewable energy. Some states such as New Mexico and Hawaii have even  ""Because the federal government has been stagnant on these issues for a long time, a huge amount of activity has shifted to the states,"" said Victor.   Despite Trump's promise to rescue the coal industry, the United States continues to move away from coal in favor of cleaner alternatives. Coal peaked in America in 2011 and has continued to decline as  Coal-fired power generation  last year to the weakest level since 1976, the US Energy Information Administration said this week. While coal continued to lose market share, natural gas and wind power generation hit record highs in the United States last year, the EIA said.   That trend is expected to continue. The EIA projected US coal power generation will plunge by another record 25% in 2020, while renewables will grow 11%.   And carbon emissions are also going in the right direction. The EIA expects energy-related CO2 emissions to drop by 11% this year, although analysts attribute that mostly to the weak economy and travel restrictions imposed to fight the pandemic.  In another milestone, the United States generated more power from renewable energy than coal  , according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which said it was any month. That feat is impressive considering there were only 38 days all of last year where renewables beat coal.   More renewable power projects are on the way.  On Monday, the Trump administration  to build the largest solar project in American history. The massive Gemini Solar Project, slated to be built in the desert of Nevada, could provide enough renewable energy to power 260,000 homes in Las Vegas and Southern California. The $1 billion project is backed by a division of Warren Buffett's     empire.   In addition to the rise of renewable energy, coal's demise has been driven in large part by the shale revolution, which unlocked vast amounts of natural gas and oil trapped under ground, has been a major force behind coal's demise. The United States now has an abundance of cheap natural gas.   Yet the shale boom is also driving a spike in harmful methane emissions, which contribute to climate change.   The World Economic Forum report noted that more than half of global methane emissions last year came from North American shale oil and gas production. The authors said technologies and regulations to limit methane emissions ""should be deployed urgently.""

"""We're developing turbines at a scale where they can be deployed easily in remote communities, coastal businesses, island communities and resorts,"" Douglas Hunt, managing director of Mako Energy, told CNN Business.  Although tidal energy is still in its infancy, it could help to reduce Australia's dependence on fossil fuels.  ""The majority of the energy in the national grid is from coal,"" explained Jenny Hayward, a research scientist at Australia's national science agency, CSIRO. ""We also have wind and solar PV [photovoltaic].""  Renewable energy accounted for just 6% of Australia's primary energy consumption and 17% of its electricity generation in the 2017-2018 fiscal year, according to the country's  . This is partly because Australia has  . But renewables are growing and Australia increased its wind generation by   that year.  The island nation is only beginning to explore tidal power through a number of  . But this form of energy has one major advantage: its predictability. While the sun may not shine, or the wind may not blow, the sea moves in predictable tidal currents. Large tidal energy systems can be expensive to install. The world's biggest tidal power station, at Sihwa Lake in South Korea, cost almost   to build in 2011. A Mako turbine costs between $20,000 and $70,000, depending on the power output and the location. So far, Mako's customers have predominantly been large industrial and government sites, but it wants to make its turbines accessible to energy customers big and small. ""Tidal turbines have been around, but the challenge has been to build them cost effectively,"" said Hunt. Reducing costs means turbines could be accessible to everyone from coal-fired power plants looking to add green energy to their operation, to off-grid coastal communities.  ""It's built at a scale where individuals are easily available to do the maintenance without expert crews,"" said Hunt. This means a community, business or household with access to flowing water could generate its own power and service its turbines locally. ""We want to contribute to an energy mix that is less reliant on fossil fuels, by empowering local businesses and communities to generate their own power from a predictable and abundant source that is hiding in plain sight — often flowing directly past communities,"" says Hunt. While the potential of tidal energy might seem as vast as the ocean, there are challenges to overcome.   that ""the magnitude of this resource has not been sufficiently quantified."" One 2017  points to a lack of research into the possible effects of tidal installations on marine life, and   considers high construction costs a barrier to the deployment of tidal power worldwide. Australia's government is currently investing in various  . It says that this will enable policymakers to better understand how tidal and wave power can contribute to the country's energy mix. Among those harnessing this tidal potential is Sydney-based Mako Energy. The company makes underwater turbines ranging between two and four meters in diameter. One turbine operating in constantly flowing water can produce enough electricity to power up to 20 homes. Their design enables them to generate electricity even in slow-flowing water, meaning they could be used in rivers and irrigation canals as well as the ocean.","Dan Tham,Nell Lewis,CNN Business",world,"Updated 4:26 AM ET, Thu May 7, 2020 ",How Australia could harness its tides for energy ,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/07/business/australia-tidal-energy-gec-spc/index.html
"Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.  ""We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building,"" Nowak said.  More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.  ""Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region.""  The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.  The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.  Nowak lists   to society:  Trees  , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. ""Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass,"" Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a  . ""A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves,"" the authors wrote. Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.  Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. ""The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up.""  Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.  Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.   Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown    Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.  Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and  Many studies have found connections between   Some hospitals have added tree views and plantings for patients as a result of these studies.   for children and families due to evidence that nature exposure lowers blood pressure and stress hormones. And studies have associated living near green areas with .  Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.  Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, ""and people don't like raking leaves."" But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. ""You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees."" ""You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways.""  Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help ""affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being.""  Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt. ""A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate,"" explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta. ""That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore."" The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.   ""We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure."" Levine adds. ""We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. ""  Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. ""We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true.""   If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.  Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.   Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. ""It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow.""  Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards  and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.  Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because ""I hear people running their lawn mowers."" Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like. Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.  But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that  from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.  If we continue on this path, ""cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants,"" said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Read:  But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.  The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people. Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research   that the typical ""super-rich"" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average. Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. ""Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires,"" she said.     ""Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot,"" said Otto. ""For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying."" In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple. Read:  Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.  ""A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers,"" said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new   that highlights consumption in high-income cities.  ""High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions,"" he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.  As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.  Oxfam   that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion. But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.  Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement  .  Among them is Hollywood actor  , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment   -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who   to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.  Watch:  ""You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows,"" said Otto.  And with divestment, a little can go a long way. ""We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest,"" said Otto. ""If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns.""   Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.  Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.   ""Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something,"" said Otto. ""There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving. ""But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks,"" she explained. The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.  In May, a group of scientists   to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an ""extraordinary increase"" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.  ""We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy,"" the letter said. There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action:  A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.  The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.  ""High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth,"" said Otto. ""It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like."" For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.  ""We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth,"" said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who   that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs. ""We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a ""good life"" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said.

"The Trump administration first suggested it would change its view of Hong Kong several weeks ago, when China began preparing to impose a sweeping   on the city. Critics of the law say it undercuts political and legal freedoms that have existed since Britain handed the former colony to China in 1997. Since the law , concerns over Hong Kong among foreign businesses and political leaders have only grown. Some tech companies have   from the market, while companies have expressed concern about the new law's broad reach and ambiguity. The New York Times on Tuesday also   that it would move some of its staff based in Hong Kong to Seoul as it began to ""make contingency plans."" Alongside the decision to end the special trading relationship Tuesday, Trump also signed a separate piece of legislation that would impose sanctions on businesses and individuals that are seen as helping China restrict Hong Kong's autonomy.  Without its privilege as a special economy under US law, ""there won't be big differences between Hong Kong and other big Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai,"" said Simon Lee, senior lecturer of international business at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Foreign companies will think whether they need to maintain their existing scale of operations in Hong Kong."" Following Trump's announcement, China on Wednesday pledged to retaliate with sanctions of its own on US officials and entities. It did not elaborate. On Tuesday, it       for selling arms to Taiwan. In a statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry called on Washington to ""stop interfering in any way in China's internal affairs, including Hong Kong affairs."" It also urged the Trump administration to refrain from implementing its new law regarding Hong Kong. Since 1992, Hong Kong's special status has allowed the goods passing through its borders to undergo different controls than those in the mainland. During the US-China trade war, for example, it allowed Hong Kong to avoid the tariffs that Washington imposed on Chinese goods.  The new executive order could put an end to that, as it aims to ""revoke license exceptions"" for exports to Hong Kong. Hong Kong doesn't do a huge amount of direct trade with the United States, according to Iris Pang, chief economist of Greater China at ING. In 2018, America   in goods and services from Hong Kong, while exporting $50 billion — a trivial amount compared to the nearly $740 billion in goods and services traded that year between the United States and China. And the majority of goods exported from Hong Kong — about 99% — are re-exports, meaning that they are goods passing through the territory from another country, Pang explained. That means that if those goods are from mainland China, they are already subject to any tariff that applies to Chinese goods. So ""in terms of tariffs, there should be no difference whether there is a removal of the special status,"" Pang wrote in a May research report. What's more concerning is the overall deteriorating relationship between the United States and China, she told CNN Business. For example, Trump said in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday that he was not interested in discussing a potential phase two trade deal with China in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The two countries  , which involved an agreement by China to buy hundreds of billions of dollars worth of products from the United States. ""I'm not interested right now in talking to China,"" Trump said. ""They hit us with the plague, so right now I'm not interested in talking to China about another deal."" The prospect of a ""second wave"" in the trade war would be far more damaging to Hong Kong's economy than the new US edict on the city, said Pang. Trade is only one part of the story.  In recent months, tensions have been bubbling up between China and the West, turning Hong Kong into a political battleground and raising even more questions about the city's future.  The city had already been hit hard by the trade war, as well as long-running anti-government protests, which  . Then the coronavirus pandemic  , just months before the national security law was imposed. Foreign businesses have expressed concern about the new law. More than 68% of businesses that responded to   that published earlier this week said they were ""more concerned"" than a month ago.  One respondent wrote that the legislation was ""extremely broad and could be used for anything at all."" Authorities in Hong Kong, though, insist the law is needed to restore stability after months of unrest. Last week, tech companies began pulling back on or re-examining their operations there.    ,    ,    ,     and       they would temporarily stop honoring government data requests about their Hong Kong users, while TikTok — which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance but has significant US operations —   entirely. ""Hong Kong is just a city in the gap between the political conflict between the two large superpowers,"" George Leung, CEO of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, told CNN Business. ""We are just an international business city here doing business between the East and West, and should not be suffering from the threat of sanctions on anything affecting the Hong Kong wellbeing."" More serious consequences also appear to have been discussed.  Fears that the United States could punish China by undermining the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar resurfaced last week after   that Washington was considering options to weaken the currency. Citing anonymous sources, the news outlet said some suggestions — including limiting the ability of Hong Kong banks to buy US dollars — had been raised among political advisers to the US State Department.  The news outlet later   that Trump decided against the idea, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — the city's de facto central bank — has made clear that it has enough in reserve to support the peg.  But the concept itself  , and it takes on renewed significance as Hong Kong's status as a safe haven for global business is debated. While the Trump administration has not pursued the ""nuclear option"" of targeting the Hong Kong dollar, the city's international relevance ""would immediately be called into question"" if that were to occur, said Brock Silvers, chief investment officer for Hong Kong-based Adamas Asset Management. Silvers added, though, that Hong Kong could emerge from the geopolitical firestorm with some benefits. The city, after all, in recent weeks   that fear their business prospects in the United States may be in jeopardy. ""The role of Hong Kong was already evolving in light of its newly redefined relationship with China,"" Silvers said. ""Although Hong Kong's international role could diminish over time if concerned firms relocate to Singapore and elsewhere, Hong Kong may find new relevance as a center for Chinese finance."" The latest blow to the city's standing came Tuesday, when US President Donald Trump followed through on a threat to   the United States'   with Hong Kong, which has in the past exempted the city from certain tariffs, among other privileges.

"""Based on what we know right now, we believe approximately 130 accounts were targeted by the attackers in some way as part of the incident,"" the company  . ""For a small subset of these accounts, the attackers were able to gain control of the accounts and then send tweets from those accounts."" The attack is a stark reminder, in the middle of a pivotal election year, about the power of social media in general, and     in particular, to destabilize America and the world. Despite it having a significantly smaller user base than rivals like    , Twitter has a disproportionately large influence on the media, investors and policymakers. It's where news breaks, CEOs make   and US presidents sometimes declare new policies. And Wednesday's attacks showed how much trust the public places in Twitter's hands, and how brittle its systems can be. It still isn't clear what the attackers' ultimate goals were. But what little has been revealed about the hack so far has already raised serious concerns from policymakers, security experts and some close to Twitter. With the level of access they enjoyed, the hackers could have triggered a sell-off in the financial markets, issued fake policy pronouncements or disrupted entire presidential campaigns.  ""If Ivanka [Trump's] account were to tweet the extreme hypothetical, 'I'm so proud of my father tonight for making the hard decisions; nuclear war is never easy, but we'll win it,' that would ... be problematic,"" said an ex-Twitter employee, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a former employer. Neither Ivanka Trump nor President Donald Trump's account appeared to have been affected by the hack; the White House declined to comment on the matter Wednesday afternoon. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that Dan Scavino, Director of Social Media at the White House, has been in ""constant contact"" with Twitter over the last 18 hours to keep the president's account secure.  ""The president will remain on Twitter,"" McEnany told the press confirming that the president's account was never hacked and remains secure.  Others in DC, including one of the president's sons, were still struggling to post on the platform Thursday as a result of sweeping and drastic measures Twitter took to   many accounts, including all verified ones. Twitter later relaxed the measure, but as of Thursday afternoon, accounts belonging to Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner and Donald Trump Jr. remained unable to tweet. On Wednesday evening, Twitter offered a preliminary explanation for the hack. It blamed a ""coordinated social engineering attack"" against some of its employees who had access to ""internal systems and tools,"" Twitter  . The hackers then ""used this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf,"" Twitter  . ""We're looking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed and will share more here as we have it."" Twitter declined to comment for this story. The hackers who controlled the accounts posted fake tweets urging Twitter users to send money to a number of bitcoin wallets, promising that users would be paid back double. Instead, the hackers appeared to simply take the money and run — with   flowing into the wallets by Thursday morning. All bitcoin transactions are visible on a public ledger, making the hack an even greater spectacle. Those wallets will be forever radioactive as law enforcement eyes them for withdrawals or transfers that could be traced back to the original attackers, said Kenn White, a security principal at the software database company MongoDB.  ""Those [bitcoin] addresses will be scrutinized closer than any in history,"" he said. For such a disruptive hack, the money involved pales in comparison to the kind of   payouts hackers can routinely expect from other types of financially motivated attacks. In addition to being relatively small in financial terms, the profits from this week's Twitter attack are insignificant in light of how deeply the hackers appear to have penetrated Twitter's systems.  ""If you've stolen a Ferrari, why just drive around the block?"" White said. As the crisis unfolded Wednesday night, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, a major critic of Silicon Valley, sent a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.  ""Millions of your users rely on your service not just to tweet publicly but also to communicate privately through your direct message service,"" Hawley  . ""A successful attack on your system's servers represents a threat to all of your users' privacy and data security.""  The Federal Trade Commission is also likely to investigate — opening the door to potential fines or other penalties, according to David Vladeck and Jessica Rich, two former directors of the agency's consumer protection bureau.  Twitter's own investigation is still ongoing, and it isn't clear what data the hackers may have accessed. Twitter also hasn't disclosed who may have been behind the attack or any information about the targeted employees. Two US intelligence officials told CNN Wednesday night that it is still too early to tell if the attack was the work of a nation state or a state-sponsored actor.  But some security experts are bracing for the worst. By using the hijacked accounts to push a bitcoin scam, the attackers publicly advertised their successful attack — guaranteeing that Twitter would swiftly respond and lock them out, said Theresa Payton, the former White House chief information officer under President George W. Bush.  While that could indicate nothing more than a play for notoriety and a quick cash grab, she said, the hackers could have downloaded information about the accounts for later release — potentially including private messages, photos, phone numbers and email addresses. That would be damaging enough at any time, but during a critical election year in which trust in platforms and their handling of information remain key concerns, the stakes could not be higher.  ""Are they going to come back later with a 'dump and dox' campaign or a blackmail situation?"" said Payton. ""We only know about the accounts they flipped with that message. How about all the other accounts they didn't flip with that message?"" But while the scope of the incident was massive in its own right — impacting accounts belonging to Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West and Warren Buffett — it could merely be the tip of a very large iceberg with vast security implications. Cybersecurity experts and policymakers now worry that the bitcoin scam may mask a much more troubling data breach involving the personal communications of the world's most powerful people.  The FBI said Thursday it is now investigating the incident. Later on Thursday, Twitter   that it was working with users who had been affected by the breach and ""continuing to assess whether non-public data related to these accounts was compromised.""

"At some point during the ordeal, the victims, a married couple, consumed pesticides in protest of their removal. It is not clear for how long they had been living and farming on the land.  The two individuals are now in stable condition, S. Vishwanathan, the head of the Guna district administration, said on Wednesday. Vishwanathan said in a video posted to Twitter by the state's public affairs department that the couple had refused to be taken to the hospital after drinking the pesticides, which forced police to ""take control of the situation.""  Vishwanathan and the superintendent of police have since been removed from their posts by the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and a probe has been ordered into the incident, the department said. Six other police officers were also removed from their posts.  Both of the victims are Dalits, the caste often referred to as ""untouchables"" in India.  , but the 2,000-year-old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth still exists in many aspects of life. The caste system categorizes Hindus at birth, defining their place in society, what jobs they can do and who they can marry.

The incident has prompted outrage across the country, including from ministers of the governing party in the state and other high-ranking politicians.

"A religious movement that emerged in China in the mid-1990s, Falun Gong surged in popularity nationwide before it was banned and brutally suppressed on the mainland in 1999. But it continues to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the territory's greater human rights protections.  For decades now, Falun Gong protests against the Chinese government have been a common sight on the city's streets, with practitioners setting up gory mock surgery scenes to raise awareness about  , and handing out free copies of the Falun Gong-linked newspaper, Epoch Times. Protesters have also targeted Chinese politicians and offices in the city, and regularly take part in mass anti-government rallies and marches.  Crossing the border by bus from China and seeing Falun Gong practitioners handing out anti-Communist Party leaflets was once one of the most visible signs of Hong Kong's relative autonomy from Beijing.  All that could soon be deemed illegal under a   that criminalized ""acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security."" Similar laws in China have been used to go after Falun Gong practitioners, which Beijing denounces as an "" "" that ""preaches heretical fallacies that are anti-humanity and anti-science"" through the control of people's minds. Falun Gong practitioners reject these charges and maintain they have been unfairly targeted and suppressed by the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are believed to be held ""at various prisons and extralegal detention centers"" in mainland China,   -- an accusation Beijing also denies.  ""The new National Security Law will act like a sharp knife hanging over the (association) and the heads of every Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,"" said Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Falun Dafa Association. ""We are very concerned.""  Hong Kong officials have claimed the new law is necessary and will only affect a handful of individuals. In early July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed back against the suggestion the law would undermine people's freedoms.  ""The legal principles that we attach a lot of importance to, like presumption of innocence and no retrospective effect and so on, are being upheld,"" she said. ""Instead of spreading fear, the law will actually remove fear and let Hong Kong people return to a normal, peaceful life."" A government spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about concerns regarding religious freedom under the law.  Hong Kong has long been a safe haven for entities which could never operate in China, from banned religious movements and labor rights NGOs, to big tech firms blocked by the Great Firewall. The fate of groups like Falun Gong -- fierce opponents of Beijing who, while not the immediate targets of the law still come within its broad remit -- will test those assurances to the hilt. Founded by Li Hongzhi in northeastern China in the early 1990s, Falun Gong blends traditional Chinese qigong practices and new age beliefs. It was   by the Chinese government and state media as part of a nationwide qigong craze, but as Falun Gong grew in size, attracting millions of followers, the authorities turned on the group.  Li encouraged a blistering public relations strategy in a bid to win over the critics, and between 1996 and 1999, the group staged some 300 protests and demonstrations, historian David Ownby writes in "" .""  This culminated in an audacious, and strategically disastrous, demonstration around central government headquarters in Beijing involving around 10,000 practitioners. It was the biggest protest the capital had seen since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and was the beginning of the end for Falun Gong in China.  The protesters in Beijing were calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the faith, but the Chinese authorities responded with a massive crackdown and huge propaganda push demonizing Falun Gong.  ""I was shocked,"" said Rose, a Hong Kong-based Falun Gong practitioner. ""I had friends who were traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing, they told me a crackdown was about to take place, but I said this was impossible, Falun Gong was just a belief, nothing political.""  Originally from mainland China, Rose began practicing Falun Gong after moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s. CNN is withholding her full name due to fears of prosecution under the new security law.  After Falun Gong was banned, Rose's husband and several of her close friends urged her to keep a low profile, to just do her exercises and readings at home. But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong.  ""A group of us went to the Liaison Office,"" she said. ""But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.""  The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city. Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard.  One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was ""peaceful and largely static.""  Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled   of the right to protest and use ""reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.""  The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office.  While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit.  In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate ""overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China."" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal.  The new crime of ""collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security"" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located.  Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who ""conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support"" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be ""provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.""  With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland.  ""How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,"" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of ""The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.""  Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that  Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group.  ""The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,"" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group.  Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland.  ""It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,"" he said.  Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city ""would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.""  ""Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,"" she added. ""It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.""  But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a   this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences.  ""Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,"" Kwong said. ""They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China."" Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants.  Media groups have   about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club   Lam ""seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.""  Lam previously said ""the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.""  ""If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,"" she added.  Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying ""Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party"" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city. Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Communist Party ,"" has called on the West to "" "" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging  .  Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment.  Like Apple Daily,  , currently facing charges related to  , Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces. Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance.  In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it  .  Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists.  Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian   that under the new law ""horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.""  But with  , the scope of the law would appear to be expanding.  Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation.  Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people ""continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.""  Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them.  ""The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,"" she said. ""But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong."" Marchers, dressed all in yellow, carried purple lotus plants, yin-yang symbols, and other traditional Buddhist icons.

"There is no telling how grim things might get for Brazilians left largely unprotected by their President, Jair Bolsonaro. But while Bolsonaro's pandemic management influences immediate life and death for Brazilians, the far-right populist sometimes known as ""Tropical Trump"" also manages protection of the Amazon. And in the middle of a man-made climate crisis, earth scientists say this gives him an undue -- and scary -- influence over   of Life as We Know It. For generations.  The Amazon is  , a keystone of diversity and home to a tenth of the world's wildlife. Under Bolsonaro's watch, it is being destroyed at record rates.  Studies found that last year alone, 3,000 square miles were destroyed, an area almost the size of Puerto Rico. Ninety-nine percent of the deforestation came from illegal logging and slash-and-burn land grabs, while illegal gold mining not only destroyed plants and animals from thousands of species but also turned the soil into toxic sludge and sand where nothing can grow for centuries. Since   in the modernist Alvorada Palace on July 7, Bolsonaro has used social media to express more sympathy for the state of the economy than tens of thousands of lives lost.  He posts complaints about his restrictions and tweets endorsements of his favorite anti-malarial drugs, unproven by science yet produced and stockpiled by the Brazilian military.  After forcing out two qualified health ministers who dared argue against his policies with science, a loyal general with no public health experience is now running the pandemic response while refusing to talk to the media.  In parallel moves, Bolsonaro ran for office in brash denial of climate science and promised not to protect ""a single centimeter"" of indigenous land. As last year's so-called ""burning season"" pushed  , he blamed Leonardo DiCaprio and other environmentalists for setting fires to make him look bad. DiCaprio  while maintaining his support to the Brazilian people working to save the forest. When Ricardo Galvao, an MIT-trained plasma physicist and the head of Brazil's National Institute of Space Research insisted on sharing real-time satellite data of Amazon deforestation with the world, Bolsonaro accused Galvao of fudging the numbers and fired him.  ""In one special area (of protected Amazon) we gave more than 15 warnings per day there was deforestation on the scale of 10 hectares or more,"" Galvao told me. ""There was no action by the government, no action at all. We were ignored. And when we sounded the alarm, we were fired.""  Last week, Lubia Vinhas, the general coordinator for INPE's Earth Observation Agency, was sacked after satellite data showed that   in June. That's virgin rainforest bigger than Dallas, Texas, gone in a month.  Like coronavirus, Bolsonaro put the Army in charge of stopping deforestation. And critics see another example of scientific expertise ignored in favor of military fealty and a vision of unchecked economic growth.   As the pandemic raged, video of a Bolsonaro cabinet meeting released by Brazil's Supreme Court showed Environment Minister Ricardo Salles  to roll back protection of land, water and indigenous people. ""Brazil is a real hell for the entrepreneur, for those who want to invest in the country and for those who want to do something even in the (working class),"" Salles said in defense after his words went public. ""Reports, surveys, licenses, permits are difficult."" Indigenous rights are often the strongest defense against development, and the original residents of the Amazon are being decimated by the virus.  , including clean water.  ""Water is life,"" Clareñcio Urepariwe told me. He is one of the dwindling Xavante people who had this edge of the Amazon to themselves for so long, their immune systems are weaker against invasive disease. ""Water is where we come from and how we live. So the veto is a form of extermination. (Bolsonaro's) deputy says we should drink from the rivers but the rivers are contaminated."" It was a soybean trucker who first brought coronavirus to the geographical center of Brazil, less than a century after   for the Lost City of Z and vanished in the thick jungle.  Today that   as far as the eye can see. And if Bolsonaro gets his way, most of the Amazon will be plowed, mined and paved in another century. But science warns that without the rain forest, there will be no rain. Rampant deforestation will only uncork more novel viruses, experts say, and accelerate the climate crisis as jungles turn to deserts. ""Like anywhere in the world there are good people and bad people,"" Fabianno Dall Agnoll says as we walk through neat rows of black bean shoots. He farms 2,000 acres in the Mato Grosso region where Fawcett vanished, and he's part of a local group vowing to ""Produce, Conserve and Include.""  He says hundreds of local farmers are committed to monitoring satellite deforestation data in an effort to heal forests and indigenous relations with smart land management. But the idea only works with access to the national satellite data.   Thanks to Bolsonaro's management of the environment and the pandemic, as well as corruption scandals involving him and his sons, more than 50 formal requests for impeachment of Bolsonaro have been received by Brazil's lower house of Congress. Given the fierce politics around the pandemic, there is no sign of action.  Action is coming from outside Brazil, too. Led by Norway, a group of global investors and sovereign wealth funds worth trillions recently threatened to pull their money out of Brazil. If that doesn't lead to real enforcement, there are 27 more months before Bolsonaro is up for reelection. Or 27 pieces of the Amazon, the size of Dallas, Texas. But while Americans complain about the   (rightly so), they need only look one country down on the list to see ... it could be so much worse.

""Many people did not believe me and kept telling me what I was saying about lead poisoning was made up, but now the court has seen the community was exposed to this danger,"" Omido said. Omido worked at the lead-acid battery recycling plant, Metal Refinery EPZ, as a community relations manager in 2009.  She quit after three months when her baby became sick and doctors found lead in her son's blood test they said he might have ingested from her breast milk. ""My son was sick but I was also not feeling good. Our eyes at the factory would be watering and the smell from the factory was pungent.

""The most important thing now is to test all the children and ensure that those affected have access to medication all of them on medication and to clean the environment so the community can live in a place that is safe for then,"" she told CNN. The court ordered the government to clean up Owino Uhuru, a village on the outskirts of Mombosa, within four months and gave the relevant agencies 90 days to pay out the compensation money.

"Dr. Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, could not specify exactly how 2,000-plus health care workers became infected but initially, he said, the country faced personal protective equipment shortages that made it difficult for workers to adequately protect themselves.  Since then, he said, the number of those infected has reduced significantly.  ""Over 90 percent of the infected has recovered and we now have a sufficient supply of PPE,"" Kuma-Aboagye said to CNN on Thursday.   He added that he continues to work closely with the public and private health sector to ensure the necessary PPE is provided and has confirmed that proper infection prevention and control measures are routinely conducted at all hospitals.  Ghana President Nana Akufo-Addo announced in an address to the nation that he would extend an incentive to medical professionals ""due to the immense dedication and hard work being exhibited by our health care workers.""  Each frontline health care worker, he said, would receive an additional 50% allowance added to their basic salary for the next three months.  In June, the Ghanaian government began a phased approach to bring the country back to normalcy after a three-week lockdown and months of a strict public gathering ban. But as religious institutions, schools and restaurants have gradually reopened , the number of confirmed cases continues to skyrocket. More than 26,000 people have contracted the virus as of July. Of those, 139 are dead.  ""The number of cases we currently have should not be translated to mean it is because of the directive to reopen our country,"" the Director of Public Health at the Ghana Health Service, Dr. Badu Sarkodie, told CNN.  ""We have taken extreme measures ensuring people adhere to our protocols to maintain social distancing, wear masks, wash hands, and we have ordered that establishments check temperatures before patrons can enter."" Sarkodie further maintains that quarantine and treatment centers have been placed throughout the country and his team is ""actively and meticulously"" monitoring to assess whether tightening of restrictions should be imposed again.  Some critics argue that the ease of restrictions came too soon, but Sarkodie insists that the livelihood of Ghanaians had to be taken into consideration when the decision was made to reopen the country.  ""The possibility of famine and poverty could possibly run rampant and would have a devastating impact if measures are not taken to get Ghanaians back to work,"" he said.  Earlier this month, Akufo-Addo elected to self-isolate for 14 days after ""at least one person within his close circle tested positive for Covid-19."" While the president tested negative, he took the measure out of an abundance of caution, the Information  ""We wish we were not here,"" Ghana Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah, told CNN.

"""This is the golden age of space in the UAE,"" explained Fatma Hussain Lootah, manager of the team's instrument science section.   ""This is the time we decided to stand out in maybe a sector nobody expected us to develop in, because it's knowledge-based, it's very science-based.""  The UAE's space ambitions are part of a push for economic diversification in a country where oil dominates the economy. The sector accounted for   of the nation's GDP last year, but the government believes that initiatives like the Emirates Mars Mission will help by encouraging students to explore new subjects. ""The UAE government wanted to inspire Emirati youth to go into STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and wanted to use this mission as a catalyst for change in multiple sectors, which includes academic sector, industrial sector and economic sector,"" said Omran Sharaf, the mission's project manager.   To emphasize these intentions, the autonomous spacecraft was named ""Al Amal,"" which translates to ""Hope"" in English. The team believes this gesture will resonate beyond the UAE.  ""We all know that we're in a region that has turmoil ... so when it was called the Hope probe, it was kind of a symbol of hope, not just for Emirati youth, for the youth of the entire area,"" said Lootah. ""And just to give them hope that ... this is a new era, this is an era where there's going to be science. There's going to be technology. There is going to be spacecrafts ... everything is possible."" The Arab world will watch those ambitions take flight when the probe launches from Tanegashima, Japan.  Simply making it this far was an impressive feat for the Gulf country. Most Mars missions take between 10 to 12 years to develop, according to Sharaf. But scientists at the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre, in Dubai, had just six years to carry out the project.  If all goes according to plan, Hope will spend an entire Martian year in orbit, or 687 days, analyzing hydrogen and oxygen levels. This data will provide unprecedented information about Mars' atmosphere, which could help scientists better understand why the planet became uninhabitable.  But even though the probe is still seven months away from reaching Mars, Sharaf says that the project has already achieved success in the UAE. ""Since the mission was announced we've seen the impact of the mission at different sectors. We've seen universities starting science programs that they didn't have in the past ... we've seen undergraduate students switching majors from finance and international relations to sciences."" ""So when it comes to the vision itself, we've already seen the impact."" Three countries -- the UAE, US and China -- are embarking on missions this summer, taking advantage of the biennial window when Earth and Mars are closest together.  The  , which aims to capture the most comprehensive picture yet of the Red Planet's atmosphere, will be the first of the trio to lift off.

"That, in turn, could prevent the need for dreaded lockdowns that would wipe out 5% from US GDP, the report said. ""We find that face masks are associated with significantly better coronavirus outcomes,"" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in in the report. In April, the federal government issued a ""recommendation"" to wear masks in public. However, unlike such countries as Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom and Mexico, there is no nationwide requirement to do so in the United States   President Donald Trump, who claims masks are a   refuses to publicly wear one himself.   There is a wide disparity between mask usage within the United States even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, says  For instance, Goldman Sachs said that only 40% of people in Arizona say they always wear a mask in public, compared with nearly 80% in Massachusetts.  A national mandate would increase usage ""meaningfully,"" especially in states such as Florida and Texas where masks are worn mostly voluntarily, the Goldman Sachs report said. Overall, a mandate could lift the percentage of people who wear masks by 15 percentage points nationally. ""Our analysis suggests that the economic benefit from a face mask mandate and increased face mask usage could be sizable,"" Hatzius wrote.  The findings stand in stark contrast to Trump's skepticism toward masks. ""Masks are a double-edged sword,"" the president in a recent interview. ""People touch them. And they grab them and I see it all the time. They come in, they take the mask. Now they're holding it now in their fingers. And they drop it on the desk and then they touch their eye and they touch their nose."" By contrast, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has voiced support for a federal mandate for masks.  ""These masks make a gigantic difference,"" Biden  . ""I would do everything possible to make it required the people had to wear masks in public."" Even House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, an ally of Trump's,   on Tuesday that he supports wearing a mask as a way to ""keep this economy open."" ""Wearing the mask is the best opportunity for us to keep this economy open, keep us working, keep us safe and help us as we build towards that vaccine where we're in a much stronger position than any country before,"" McCarthy said. The debate comes as health experts and investors grow increasingly nervous about the recent spike in coronavirus infections in Sun Belt states, especially Arizona, Texas and Florida. ""In a replay of March, the virus seems to now be starting to spin out of control in about one-third of the US,"" Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.  Morgan Stanley biotech analyst Matthew Harrison warned in a report to clients Tuesday that if Texas and Florida ""do not break their exponential growth in the next 10 days we would expect the outbreak to become uncontrollable without more aggressive measures."" Arizona, California, Florida and Texas have  , including closing bars.  and    All of this is casting further doubt on the already-limited prospects for a V-shaped recovery in the US economy from the pandemic. ""With half of the country slowly opening and half slowly closing, the economy could flatten out overall,"" Bank of America's Harris wrote.  Constance Hunter, chief economist at KPMG, told CNN Business she fears the pandemic will leave ""lasting scars"" on the labor market and entire businesses ""won't come back."" ""There is no way we are having a V-shaped recovery. It's a fantasy,"" Hunter said.  The good news is that medical experts remain optimistic about the prospects for a vaccine. Ninety-eight percent of executives and investors in the life science industry expect a vaccine will get developed, according to a survey   by Stifel Financial.  However, more than three-quarters say a vaccine won't be widely available until late next year or beyond. And more than half (52%) say there will be a second wave severe enough to cause government-imposed closures and restrictions. Any shutdowns would The shutdowns harm to the economy. Goldman Sachs estimates that the combination of government restrictions and social distancing wiped out 17% from US GDP between January and April.  ""A national face mask mandate could potentially substitute for renewed lockdowns that would otherwise subtract nearly 5% from GDP,"" Goldman Sachs argued in the Monday report.  Yet politics stan the way of such a mandate. ""So will the US adopt a national face mask mandate? This is uncertain, partly because masks have become such a politically and culturally charged issue,"" Hatzius wrote.  Hunter, the KPMG economist, said she is ""dismayed, befuddled and sad"" that masks have become such a contentious political issue because they could allow life to get back to normal sooner by depriving the virus of hosts. ""The virus has taken away our freedom and people are saying, 'I want my freedom back,'"" Hunter said. ""But the mask is a misguided target for one's negative feelings. The mask can actually give us our freedom.""

Walmart's policy change came after    said last week that it will require customers to wear facial coverings or masks in all 9,000 of its company-owned US stores beginning Wednesday.     also announced Tuesday that it will also require all shoppers coming into its approximately 1,000 stores to wear face masks. Other national chains made similar moves on Wednesday. Kroger and Kohl's announced they would start requiring all customers to wear masks, signaling that more retailers are lining up behind mask-wearing mandates. The National Retail Federation, the main lobbying group for the industry, also called on retailers to require masks for customers. Most major retailers and grocers initially hesitated to enact their own mask mandates for customers during the pandemic, partly over fears of antagonizing shoppers who refuse to wear them.

"""The kind of life event that we are currently experiencing can be a huge motivator to try something new,"" said Kerry Hannon, an expert on career transitions and author of ""Never Too Old to Get Rich: The Entrepreneur's Guide to Starting a Business Mid-Life."" But it's going to take some time.  ""A career transition is not a rash move. They can take three to five years,"" said Hannon. The first step is making sure you are not making the switch out of boredom or frustration. We all have challenging days (or weeks) at work, but that doesn't always mean you need a new career. ""You want to be moving toward a general goal or calling and not just trying to escape something,"" said Maggie Craddock, an executive coach. But sometimes we don't really have much of a choice, especially if we just got laid off or work in a shrinking industry with bleak hiring prospects.  ""Most people probably aren't going to make a jump straight away. Career transitions require laying the groundwork, but there's no time like the present to get started,"" said Hannon. Here are questions to ask when considering a career change: It might not seem obvious at first, but a lot of your work experiences and skills will likely transfer to a new profession. You just have to take the time to quantify them.  Write down your hard skills, like data analytics or marketing, along with soft skills like effective communication and leadership skills, and see where they could line up with your intended career.  Having this list will help you hone in on job postings and better pitch yourself to potential employers. ""Ultimately, you will be pitching your experience as it touches the new career field. You must show how those skills can help a company solve problems and create business,"" said Hannon. Having an ally while you pursue your new career will help you navigate the transition and help you connect with others in the field. To widen your circle of potential allies, join LinkedIn groups, reach out to friends and family members to see if they know anyone in your future industry and become a member of relevant professional groups.  Don't be shy about asking people for informational interviews: just be clear about your intentions and keep the conversation to around 20 minutes.  ""Ask them about their job and really listen,"" said Hannon. ""This isn't your sales pitch. When you get off the phone, they will really like you if you let them talk about themselves. They will have a great first impression.""  After the call, follow up with a note of your appreciation and ask who else you should talk with to start building your network.  Some career switches are going to require additional education or certifications that you should take into consideration.  It can be helpful to review the LinkedIn pages of people in your desired role to get a sense of their background and training. And with everything virtual these days, there are many online courses, seminars and training classes available online.  Just because you like to cook, doesn't mean you'd enjoy being a professional chef.  Before getting too far along a new career path, try to get a taste for it by doing some contract work or freelancing.   ""An employer doesn't have to make any big commitment and you can start showing you have some experience and passion for the new field,"" Hannon said.  To find opportunities, check out job boards like Sidhusl.com, FlexJobs.com, Upwork.com, she suggested.  If getting paid work doesn't pan out, some industries like non-profits are often looking for volunteers. Raising your hand to help out can shed light on a potential career and also be a great networking opportunity. A career change often means a reduction in income -- at least at the start.  ""Do a budget,"" said Hannon. ""Get lean and mean. You are probably going to earn a little less money when you make the shift, at least initially. Not always, but you need to be prepared for that."" Now is the time to pay down as much debt as you can and look for ways to reduce your spending. ""Debt is the biggest killer to making a career transition,"" Hannon added. ""When people go through a crisis and uncertainty and all those emotions, the first thing they think about is meaning: 'What can I do to have a meaningful impact on this world?'"" said Julie Jansen, a career coach.  But   is a big undertaking. And doing so in the middle of a pandemic that has left nearly  for unemployment benefits, can seem next to impossible. But with patience and a plan, it can be done.","Kathryn Vasel,CNN Business",business,"Updated 11:22 AM ET, Mon June 8, 2020 ","Yes, the job market is a mess, but you can still switch careers",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/success/switching-careers-pandemic/index.html

"Rausch initially cooperated with the officers, before threatening them with a gun and managing to disarm them of their ""service weapons"" before disappearing into the forest.  ""A large force of several hundred emergency services"" and helicopters were deployed around the town of Oppenau for the search efforts, authorities said.  Juergen Rieger, the head of the search operation said that Rausch was found sitting in a bush ""with four guns visible in front of him"", after a tip-off from two witnesses, Agence France-Presse news agency reported.  Reiger added that Rausch had an ax in his lap, another gun, and there was a letter in front of him, AFP reported. Friday's arrest ends a five-day search that gripped the local area. As of Thursday morning local time investigators had received more than 270 clues from the public regarding Rausch's whereabouts within the forest.  Police have reason to believe that Rausch had ""no permanent residence"" and potentially lived in the forest.  The suspect has been identified as 31-year-old Yves Rausch, and was given the nickname in local media outlets and on social media after he disappeared into the forest after an altercation with police.

"The case is one of two that have cast a harsh light on alleged police brutality in France and on the apparent impunity, some say, with which accusations of it are all too often met. Another, involving the death in police custody of   in a Paris suburb in 2016, has also seen fresh developments, with the testimony of two witnesses heard as part of the investigation last week. But four years after the 24-year-old Black man died, no charges have been brought against the officers involved. Their lawyers point to a medical assessment that blames Traoré's death on a pre-existing condition that his family says he didn't have. What the two cases have highlighted is the difficulty that families of victims face in getting allegations of police brutality properly and swiftly investigated. According to William Bourdon, a lawyer for Chouviat's family, France ""is getting more like the United States by the persistence of police brutality and by the denial that goes with it."" A spokesperson for the Paris police service declined to comment to CNN. Both cases have also led to calls for a change in policing techniques. In the Traoré case, the officers used a controversial technique that involves pinning a suspect to the ground on his stomach. In Chouviat's case, the allegations center on the use of the chokehold. Last month, under pressure from police unions, plans to ban the technique were shelved by France's then-Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. That he had even considered the move proved unpopular with the police, who held  several protests in June against him. On Monday He was replaced as interior minister on July 6 as part of a wider government reshuffle. Like in the US, there is a culture of resistance in the police force to investigating fellow officers, as well as a resistance on the part of strong police unions to attempts at reform. All the more so because of its role over the last few years in France in helping the government to put down yellow vest protests by bringing order to the streets of France once again. Some campaigners say the police have simply become too powerful.  ""I think that the outrage, the anger and sometimes the violence is fueled by this systematic rejection of any allegation,"" said Cecile Coudriou, president of Amnesty International in France. ""And the more the authorities stick to this rejection of any allegation, the more they try to refuse dialogue, including with us, with people who work based on the evidence, the worse it gets because it means people lose confidence in the authorities and lose confidence in the people who are supposed to not only to enforce the law but also to protect the people."" Another difficulty, and one that is specific to France, is the impossibility of quantifying racist incidents. France's public institutions do not collect any or data on race or ethnicity, in a laudable effort aimed at treating all citizens equally. But this law has led to a lack of data, making it difficult for non-White French people to make White French people aware of the very different reality they face. As one activist, Rhoda Tchokokam, put it, ""people are telling you that because of race, because of religion, because of gender, they're being discriminated against. If you cannot face it, then you are basically saying to the people of your country that you don't see them and that you don't care about them. So it's very important for the French state to understand that we are going to keep talking about it. And they need to start doing the same thing."" All the more so, say activists, because while the French state may not see color, the police apparently do. Non-White French people say they are subjected to identity checks far more than White people. Ben Achour, a lawyer who specializes in police brutality and discrimination, said the checks are being misused. ""What the police does,"" Ben Achour said, ""is rather than chase delinquents, they check to see if you are really French. And that allows also the frisking, the violence, the insults, and the racist slurs. That's the condition of life of a lot of kids in France. They are subjected to those kinds of actions several times a week. How can they develop self-esteem? How can they trust the republic? How can you not challenge the republic when one of the first institution you are in contact with when you are 10, 11, 12, 13 years old, is violent towards you?"" Until now, because of the data law, the problem has been impossible to quantify and the evidence was purely anecdotal. But last month a report by France's civil liberties ombudsman, former justice minister Jacques Toubon, warned that people of Black and Arab appearance were subject to police identity checks 20 times more frequently than White people.  For Achour, this first recognition of the problem by a French institution is a huge step. He told CNN that what Toubon had found was ""major systemic structural discrimination in France. And he says we need to count it. We need to measure this discrimination. You cannot fight discrimination, you cannot create policies if you don't have a measure because otherwise the problem doesn't exist. And this is why the moment is very important. We now have momentum in France."" That momentum has been helped by events in the United States. The death of George Floyd and America's national reckoning have given fresh hope to supporters of both the Chouviat and Traoré families with several protests held these last few weeks in France. Their ""Black Lives Matter"" slogan may have been imported, but they have been fueled by cases and by grievances that are entirely French. The similarities with the case of George Floyd -- a Black American killed during a police arrest in the US city of Minneapolis -- don't end there. Chouviat's arrest, also captured on video, would, like Floyd's, become the focus of a wider campaign against police brutality. And as in the Floyd case, action against the officers would seem painfully slow in coming. But six months after the death of Chouviat, who was of North African heritage, three of the police officers involved have now been placed under formal investigation, lawyers for the Chouviat family told CNN on Thursday. This, after audio of the incident -- captured by Chouviat's own phone -- was submitted to the investigating judge. The transcript of the recording, seen by CNN, shows that Chouviat repeated the words ""j'etouffe"" seven times. A lawyer for two of the police officers says his clients never heard the words as Chouviat was still wearing his motorcycle helmet at the time. All four officers deny any wrongdoing.  ",Melissa Bell,world,"Updated 9:29 AM ET, Fri July 17, 2020 ","After George Floyd, French police face fresh scrutiny over alleged brutality",https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/17/europe/france-cedric-chouviat-police-death-intl/index.html
"In an open letter to the judiciary, lawyers for the three defendants -- Amir Hossein Moradi, Saeed Tamjidi and Mohammad Rajabi -- said that they had not been given access to documents pertaining to their clients' cases, according to semi-official Jamaran News which published the letter Wednesday. The men on death row were convicted of  a crime of taking up arms to take lives or property and to create fear in the public -- and for participating ""in vandalism and arson with the intent to counter the Islamic Republic of Iran"" during the November protests last year,   condemning the sentence by more than a dozen UN human rights experts, including special investigators   and  .

"The truth is, heading back to the workplace is going to look different at every company. It might even vary   a company. On my quest to find out what we can expect as we brace for the Great Return, I've been asking company leaders about their plans. I recently spoke with Dr. Lydia Campbell, vice president and chief medical officer for IBM Corporate Health & Safety. Campbell is leading IBM's workplace reintegration strategy, which for a long time involved daily meetings with her team (including on weekends), and figuring out how to make sure employees are comfortable with and aware of all the changes and expectations they will face when they return to work. Here's what she had to say: In many of our places today where employees are coming into the office, it starts before they even leave their home with a self screening that asks them about their Covid risk: Have they been around anyone who is either a confirmed or suspected case of Covid? Have they had some of the cardinal symptoms of Covid -- breathlessness, fever and other things? We're providing our employees with masks, hand sanitizer and other things that are recommended by the CDC and the WHO. At some work sites, where required by law or because of the working situation in the office, it makes sense to do onsite screening. Meaning after their self-check, some employees are checked at the point of entry to the workplace. In our workplaces today, there are demarcated social distancing much like you might see at the mall. On our monitors and videos, employees can see reminders of how they should social distance in elevators and capacity limits and things like that. With our cafeterias, we've changed the way in which employees are serviced so there are fewer touch points, in addition to having enhanced cleaning regimens in common areas and cafeterias, restrooms, etc. I don't think there has been any definitive decision made on that. Right now, we are assessing that. We'll look at, as we come back in waves -- who needs to be at work first based on need to access workplace equipment, need to work in groups, need to have better access to internet, etc. -- then slowly enlarging the number of people who are here. We will get to some number that is probably less than 100%, probably in the next several months. But I do think what will change from now on, is we will think about the need for social distancing, the need for enhanced sanitation and cleaning, and I think that in some ways we may arrive at a situation in the future where in our new ways of working, not everyone is required to be at work or where people have more of a rotational work schedule where they are in the office on certain days and, on other days, they work from home. the full interview.

"For weeks, as coronavirus outbreaks took off in other parts of Asia, India remained relatively unaffected. It wasn't until March 13 that the country reported its first death -- and even then, it had only recorded 73 cases. When the case numbers were still relatively low, the government took action. On March 11, India suspended all tourist visas, and on March 22, all international flights were grounded. When India locked down on March 25, the country had around 519 cases and 10 deaths.  But when it was partially lifted on May 30, India had more than 180,000 cases -- and rising.  For some in India, lockdown was difficult -- if not  . Around one sixth of the urban population lives in densely-packed slums where social distancing was not an option. Thousands of daily wage earners were left without jobs or food -- and many made lengthy and   back home to far away states.  Since the nationwide lockdown lifed, some states have enforced restrictions their own restrictions -- or even resumed lockdowns. Despite that, within four months, the country has gone from just over 500 cases, to more than one million. Sanjay Rai, the president of the Indian Public Health Association, says the lockdown helped delay the outbreak, which helped buy time for the authorities to manufacture more personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. But those early steps didn't allow India to avoid the outbreak altogether.   As India's outbreak took off, it didn't spread evenly around the country.  Around 56% of India's coronavirus cases are concentrated in only three of the country's 36 states or territories -- Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, which are each home to some of India's most populous cities. Maharashtra -- where Mumbai is -- has 28% of the country's cases. But while those three states have 56% of the country's cases, they are home to only 17% of the country's population.  When you look at active cases, the picture is even more dramatic. In India, patients with mild and moderate symptoms are considered   after 10 days of symptom onset if they meet certain conditions. A test to confirm that they no longer have the virus is not required. Severe cases can only be discharged after one negative coronavirus test.  According to Rajesh Bhushan, an Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare official, more than 50% of all active cases in the country are in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where one of India's largest cities is. These worst-hit states have more cases than many countries. As of Friday, Maharashtra alone had more cases than Iran, which has a slightly lower population than the Indian state, and Pakistan, which is home to nearly twice as many people. Delhi on Friday had more cases than Canada or Argentina, which both have higher populations than the Indian capital. Hospitals in Dehi have been  .   By contrast, some parts of the country have barely reported the virus. The union territory of Lakshadweep -- a tropical archipelago off the coast of Kerala -- hasn't reported any cases. Five other states have had cases but no coronavirus deaths. As a medical expert in India, who declined to be identified as he does not have permission to speak to the press, put it: ""India is not one country. It is 30 countries, in terms of population."" Despite India's huge number of cases, officials have pointed out that the country's death toll per capita is still relatively low. India has had around 19 deaths per million people -- lower than the US, where there are 416 deaths per million, or the United Kingdom, where there are 687 deaths per million.  China had around three deaths per million. Experts have pointed to India's relatively young population. Studies show that older people are more susceptible to dying from coronavirus.  In India, almost 44% of the population is under 24, while only 15% is over 55. As Rajesh Bhushan, a health ministry official, pointed out earlier this month, that means about 75% of India's population is considered low-risk for dying of coronavirus. According to him, people aged 60 and over make up 10% of India's population, but 53% of coronavirus deaths.  By contrast, the UK -- which has one of the worst death rates per capita in the world -- has a much older population. There, 29% of the population is under 24, and 31% are over 55.  Around 93% of people in the UK who died of coronavirus in March and April were 60 or older.  Indian officials are keen to put the country's coronavirus cases in context. India has the third biggest outbreak in the world -- but it also has the second-biggest population of any country. So while India makes up 17% of the world's population, it has only 7% of the world's coronavirus cases. By contrast, the US has only 4% of the world's population and 26% of the world's coronavirus cases. The bad news, though, is that India's outbreak isn't over.  According to the unnamed medical expert, India still hasn't hit its peak.  ""We are at the top but not at the peak,"" he said. ""We are certainly not at the bottom on the curve.""

"But there was no tour of the office and having to remember the location of your new desk, no handshakes and no first-day lunch outings. Everything was all done online. Welcome to life as an intern during a pandemic.  Many companies had to quickly shift gears on their summer internship programs when their employees started working remotely earlier this year. Some companies scrapped their programs altogether, but others got creative.  ""This year, due to the speed of creating the internship opportunity in a virtual format, we are doing something we have never done before,"" said Sharyn Jones, head of talent at MassMutual. One big change for interns is that many programs will be shorter. MassMutual's program is nine weeks this year instead of the usual 11. The program at PepsiCo runs six weeks this summer, down from 10 weeks.  But in those shorter runs, companies are trying to provide the same vital experiences that make an internship worthwhile -- just in a different way.  While in-person meetings and social events are off the table, many companies are finding alternative ways to retain the mentoring and real-life problem solving that is at the core of good internship programs.  At    , for example, its 978 summer interns have been given assignments aimed at building their leadership skills and learning more about different aspects of the business, depending on their role. The interns are also divided into teams to work on projects, and assigned a coach to assist them. All the interns get a virtual tour of the company's stores, plants and distribution centers. And PepsiCo's top leadership, including its CEO, participate in live Q&A sessions with them.  The intern pool is an important pipeline for PepsiCo, said Blair Bennett, its senior vice president of talent acquisition. ""A core guiding principle of pulling together the virtual internship program is that we would be able to give our business and our managers enough interaction with the interns where they make that connection and give that assessment of the intern and vice versa,"" Bennett said. That access to top executives has turned out to be one of the advantages to doing an internship virtually.  At    , many senior executives, including founder and CEO Michael Dell, are primarily based in the US, explained Jennifer Newbill, director of university recruitment. ""Typically, the US interns are privileged from the point they get to have access or visibility to those executives -- [they] physically get in front of those interns in the US and have a session with them,"" she said. ""Now that we are all virtual and everything is on Zoom, we're able to have executive presentations as well as professional development, skill building, all of that is available and consistent globally."" Dell intern Jordan McElroy has been taking full advantage of this increased access. ""We have more exposure to upper level VPs and senior VPs that I probably wouldn't have in the office,"" said the senior at Hanover College in Indiana. ""I am sure they would have been traveling and busy, but now they are sitting in their living rooms or at their kitchen tables and I get to sit down and speak with a lot of those people as well and really learn about their careers."" The social aspects of an internship are an important part of the experience: Team lunches and happy hours, forging friendships with other interns and finding mentors to become lifelong career coaches.  But all of this can still happen virtually.  Teams can order food in on the same day and eat together, interns hold daily Zoom calls to check in with one another and, perhaps most importantly, have virtual progress reports and feedback meetings with their managers and mentors.   When everyone is working remotely, communication can be a challenge even for seasoned employees, so many companies have taken added steps to make sure interns feel supported and know where to go for help.  MassMutual interns are assigned a manager, an intern coordinator and a buddy to help navigate their journey. Without things like lunch, walks around campus and being able to peek over a cubicle wall to ask a question, the company has sought to be more intentional with communication. ""This summer we gave both the buddy and the intern coordinator much more accountability in terms of involvement and frequency of contact to ensure our interns feel included and integrate seamlessly into what has definitely been anything from a normal time for any of us,"" said Jones. The company had Zoom sessions for managers to review intern responsibilities and expectations and also provided tips on managing remotely. At Dell, some of the interns meet with each other daily. Sometimes teams would order lunch and eat together remotely.  ""I feel like they could be my best friends in real life,"" McElroy said of her relationship with the other interns. ""I hope I get to meet them someday. We have gotten really close. We try to Zoom at least 30 minutes every day just to fill each other in on what we accomplished the prior day and what we need to tackle that day.""  Dell also works with members of its employee resource groups to find mentors for interns.  ""This year it kind of blew up,"" said Newbill. ""We had more people volunteer to be a mentor than we had interns.""  To help maintain some of the perks of in-person programs, companies still provide food and entertainment to interns -- they just do so remotely. PepsiCo's interns received a gift box of company products before the program started, as well as a beach towel during the program. The company also created a five-part podcast series to prepare interns ahead of their first day. Topics included background about the company, advice from previous interns and how to work from home effectively.  There have also been TikTok competitions and the company will host a celebrity sports panel for all interns later in July. A group of interns at Dell were sent painting kits to paint together virtually. There was also a recent bake-off challenge and an intern talent show.  ""We want it to be an experience where they learn, but they build their network, they build skills and most importantly, they have fun,"" said Newbill. This year, it kicked off with a virtual dance party.  The rest of the day, the interns got to know one another by participating in team-building activities, playing MassMutual trivia, listening to speakers, and learning about the company's communication tools. They also met with their manager and other team members.

"""Half the restaurants we're going to now, we find out upon delivering to them that they're closed,"" he said. ""A lot of times I'll pull up to restaurants and I'll just have to read the sign on the front door whether they're open or not.""  He's now sitting on a surplus of about 24,000 eggs, he estimates. And he has no idea when, or if, things will stabilize. The unpredictability is a major problem for Storey Farms in Johns Island, South Carolina. If Storey can't predict what demand for his eggs will look like tomorrow, much less months out, he runs the risk of overproducing — which would leave him with an expensive surplus — or underproducing, which would prevent him from having enough eggs on hand to meet demand. Storey's not alone. His challenges are representative of the difficulties faced by farmers who sell to independent restaurants when they try to predict demand in these uncertain times.  Back in March,   and stay-at-home orders took effect, some of these farmers found themselves without customers. Now, just as restaurants began to resume dine-in service, a   has paused reopening plans and put farmers back in limbo — and made it even more difficult to plan ahead.  Planning is essential to farmers because they have to anticipate their customers' demand months, and sometimes years, ahead of when they deliver so that they have enough time to grow crops or raise animals.  That's nearly impossible when restaurants are struggling to stay in business: From March to May, eating and drinking place sales were $94 billion below expected levels,  . Plunging sales and unpredictable demand have prompted many farmers to support the  which would dedicate $120 billion in aid for independent bars and restaurants through the end of the year. Recently, a number of states have paused or reversed their plans to reopen restaurant dining rooms as the coronavirus pandemic tears through the nation, making things even worse for those farmers.  New Jersey made the call   in late June, just a few days before the reopening was scheduled to take place. New York City, which was on track to reopen restaurant dining rooms,   indefinitely earlier this month. Last week, Arizona restaurants were told to  . And on Monday,   to once again close their dining rooms. As cases continue to increase, other states and cities could follow suit or tighten their restrictions.  Uncertainty ""is really what's causing the problem,"" said Gary Wertish, president of the Minnesota Farmers Union, one of the groups supporting the Restaurants Act. ""There's no end in sight,"" he said. That makes it ""really hard to plan for the future."" If the uncertainty drags out for another year or two, he said, some farms and restaurants will go out of business.   Restaurants aren't just closing because staffers have fallen ill with coronavirus.  Kate McClendon, an organic farmer based in Peoria, Arizona, said that each of the 90 restaurants served by her farm is facing its own predicament. ""We've had some restaurants close proactively because they're trying to get all of their people tested,"" McClendon said. ""We've had some that have tried to open up for takeout only and then decide that wasn't sustainable and close."" Others have had a hard time hiring back their staff, she said. McClendon runs McClendon's Select with her husband, Sean. They grow dozens of different types of fruits and vegetables, including romanesco cauliflower and romaine lettuce. The farm has been in the family for decades — but McClendon is worried about its future.  Like Storey, McClendon has also filled orders only to find that restaurants were closed upon making the delivery. She has started tracking social media to try to keep tabs on whether restaurants are still open. Typically, Sean puts together a planting plan based on patterns they've observed throughout the year. Now, they're guessing. ""We have nothing to go on,"" she said. ""We have no idea of how to predict what this is going to look like.""  It's a new world for farmers who came to rely on certain restaurants to turn a profit. ""We have a lot of stability when [restaurants are] open and doing their regular business,"" said Matt Weik, who owns Y-ker Acres, a pig farm in Northern Minnesota, and sells premium meats to restaurants. Weik and his family used to grow produce, but switched to meat about six years ago because of the accolades his pasture-raised, heritage pork received. He has long-standing relationships with independent restaurants that feature his products on their menus. Before the pandemic, he had come to learn exactly what they need.  ""I know certain restaurants that are going to do 1,000 meals a day [in] July, August and September,"" he said. ""And I know, after several years, that they're going to need this much ground pork and this much pork chops every two weeks.""  Many of the restaurants that Weik sells to have reopened. But their needs are now unknown: Recently, Weik was in the process of filling a $1,000 smoked pork-chop order for a restaurant when he learned that it was closing again, likely until August, because an employee tested positive for Covid-19.  The restaurant is still planning to pay for the order, but not until it reopens. Weik described the setback as ""another straw on the camel's back.""  Because of the upheaval, some farmers who rely on independent restaurants are now trying out a different business model.  Take Steve Matthiasson, who along with his wife owns Matthiasson winery in Napa Valley, California. This year, he ended up selling much of the wine he had designated for restaurants directly to consumers at a lower price.  The switch ""allowed us to use our wine and get our money back out of it, but we won't make any profit on it,"" Matthiasson said. ""We're going to lose money this year. We're going to operate at a loss. Hopefully, it's going to be a reasonable loss that we can ride it out.""  If farmers stop selling to restaurants, that's bad news for restaurants, too.  ""A significant portion of our crops ... are earmarked for restaurant sales,"" said Pete Skold, who co-owns Waxwing Farm in Webster, Minnesota, along with his wife. But if restaurants are closed this winter, he'll have to sell those crops to consumers. And once that commitment is made, he won't be able to pivot back to selling to restaurants because there won't be enough supply for both.  That means that some restaurants that make it through this dark period won't have a steady source of supply at the other end.  ""If restaurants close and farms pivot to other avenues, when restaurants reopen,"" Skold said, ""it's hard to just jump back onto that ship.""  But six hours later, he got a call from the building's landlord that the eggs were never collected — the restaurant had suddenly closed because a staff member tested positive for Covid-19, and nobody canceled the order.  After half a day in the hot sun, the eggs could no longer be eaten. So Storey drove back to pick them up and took the loss.","Danielle Wiener-Bronner,CNN Business",business,"Updated 3:42 PM ET, Thu July 16, 2020 ",A nightmare scenario for farmers is happening right now,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/16/business/farmers-restaurants-closures/index.html

Nikola also now plans to produce a pickup truck called the Badger, which the company says will run on a combination of electricity stored in batteries and electricity produced from compressed hydrogen. That combination, the Arizona-based company claims, will allow the Badger to drive a total of 600 miles before needing to recharge or refill.  The Badger is supposed to be produced in cooperation with a major automaker, Nikola has said, but no deal has been announced yet.  Nikola's stock was recently listed on the Nasdaq exchange through a reverse merger, a process that has   over a lack of transparency for investors when compared to a traditional initial public offering. Nikola's share price reached nearly $80 right after the company began trading on the stock exchange. It's now trading around $55 a share. Los Angeles-based startup, Faraday Future, drew its name from Michael Faraday, a 19th century British scientist who described electromagnetic induction, one of the basic principles that make electric motors work.  Faraday (the company) made a   when it unveiled its first electric vehicle, the FF 91, a luxury sedan that Faraday says is designed for autonomous driving. But progress has been slow since then. Founder YT Jia filed for bankruptcy in October 2019, but came to an agreement with creditors this month.  Deliveries of the FF 91 are aimed to start roughly nine months after it completes a fundraising round, according to the company. Faraday has said it plans to produce the FF 91 in Hanford, California, but whether that comes to fruition remains unclear.  This Chinese company has said it is planning to make a mid-size electric SUV that will have a   running the entire width of the dashboard. There's also an iPad-sized touchscreen on the steering wheel, which will stay still while you turn the wheel. Byton has also said the car could be controlled with hand gestures in the air and voice controls, features similar to those already in cars made by BMW.  But Byton has suspended operations for the foreseeable future, a move that a spokesman said was a byproduct of the pandemic's impact on fund raising. The company isn't sure when production of the car might start. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson was the chief engineer for Tesla's Model S before he left the role  . Lucid Motors, which was founded in 2007, plans to unveil a luxury vehicle called the Air in September that it has said will have a range of more than 400 miles and be able to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in under 2.5 seconds. The company said the car will cost more than $100,000.  Lucid began construction on its Casa Grande, Arizona, manufacturing facility in December 2019, and it's expected to complete the first phase of the building later this year. It has another location suitable for developing a single vehicle. The startup has raised more than $1 billion from Saudi Arabia's public investment fund.   is developing a $52,500 electric pickup truck, called the Endurance, intended for commercial fleets. The startup plans to build its truck in an old GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, using some of the equipment that had been used to make the Chevrolet Cruze. Lordstown Motors is unique because of its controversial decision to use motors located in the pickup's four wheels, which are called hub motors. It's also stood out for earning the attention of the Trump administration, as Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the Endurance's unveiling last month, lauding it as a symbol of American manufacturing.  The company received a $40 million emergency loan from GM, and is attempting to raise $450 million to begin production of the Endurance at a rate that it says will be profitable. There's not only Nikola (which took the other half of inventor Nikola Tesla's name), which briefly overtook Ford in terms of market value, despite never having produced a vehicle for sale. But there's also Rivian, Fisker, Byton, Faraday Future, and a whole lot more. Some are more established than others and some are further along in their product cycles. Most of these companies are staying out of the sedan market altogether — despite Tesla's success with the Model S and Model 3 — opting to make trucks, crossovers or vehicles that blur the boundaries between traditional categories instead.","Matt McFarland,Peter Valdes-Dapena",business,"Updated 12:59 PM ET, Thu July 16, 2020 ",These electric car startups are looking to take on Tesla,https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/16/cars/ev-startups-roundup-tesla-rivian-nikola/index.html

"""We had lines all the way down to the Costco for like two miles long and it was as if that opening day lasted a month and a half,"" Abuelhiga recalled. ""It was insane."" The accolades, a permanent brick-and-mortar restaurant location and, most importantly, customer loyalty, followed. The location -- in D.C.'s Shaw neighborhood, allowed Abuelhiga and her employees to become a central part of the local community, a crucial and often underappreciated element of small businesses around the country. Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. The first few weeks, sales dropped to nearly zero. Even as re-openings started, the restaurant never got above 50% of its regular sales, Abuelhiga said. ""It was by early June, we made the call that it was just -- we couldn't sustain the business anymore,"" she said. ""We shut it down."" The signage and hip murals still sit at its location, but affixed to the door is a letter signed by Abuelhiga and her team. Continuing on in the time of Covid-19 was simply too risky. ""It was the last thing I wanted to do and I avoided it at all costs,"" she said. ""Because I was like: What do you say, you know? What do you say to your team members? What do you say to their families? Right? What do you say to customers that feel like they've been there for you the whole time and the whole legacy of how we got started?"" Thousands of small businesses around the country are teetering on the brink of failure -- or have already shuttered like Mason Dixie. According to a  , there have been 140,000 total business closures on the web site since March 1. Of those closures, 41% are permanent, according to the company.   While the return to economic activity has led to a series of positive signs through the month of June, it has grown highly likely the economy will retreat in the weeks ahead as 27 states have now paused or started to roll back their re-openings. In a   by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), 23% of small businesses reported that they could survive for somewhere between less than one month to six months under current conditions.  While more than   tapped into the government's cornerstone aid effort -- the Paycheck Protection Program -- 22% of the  businesses the NFIB surveyed said they will still have to lay off employees as that money runs dry. Other recipients are closing their doors entirely. That was the case with Mason Dixie Biscuit Co. ""It helped us obviously get through as much of it as we could. But at the end it was just like, okay, when that gets cut off, then we can't sustain ourselves,"" Abuelhiga said. It's an issue lawmakers are keenly aware of, with the drafters of the federal aid program acknowledging that when the Paycheck Protection Program was put together, there was simply no sense that the economic devastation would drag on for as long as it has. Negotiations over the next round of small business aid, a central component of the next stimulus package talks that will begin next week, have centered on the hardest hit -- and smallest -- businesses. For Abuelhiga, there has been a ""bittersweet"" twist to the crisis -- one that underscores the uneven way the coronavirus has affected different sectors of the economy. Her second business, which makes frozen biscuits and other frozen baked goods, has experienced significant growth during the pandemic. It's a business that got its start over the last several years due to the same customers who frequented her restaurant.  ""Never in a million years could we have planned that it was going to be as crazy as it was. The demand search for us was upwards of 200% month-over-month,"" Abuelhiga said.  Her consumer product business, Mason Dixie Foods, which had already become one of the biggest regional players in the market before the pandemic, is in more than 5,000 grocery stores. Her team for the business has grown from 2 to 11 since January. Most imperiled small business owners, of course, aren't that fortunate. But Abuelhiga's experience underscores a reality for many: Efforts to innovate and find a way around the crisis are extensive and, in her view, will likely change the way entire industries operate. ""I think that everyone out there that's fighting to get through day-to-day that is thinking about what's the next way they can pivot, or [whether] they're shutting down. I can't say that you should feel like it's failure,"" she said. ""It's really just closure on a chapter. But it forces you to think: What's the next step? What's, what's the next move?"" Abuelhiga also made something else clear: The door isn't closed on a future brick-and-mortar restaurant sometime in the post-coronavirus future. ""There isn't a bone in my body that doesn't want to try this again,"" she said. A first-generation American who grew up in public housing and worked multiple jobs to put herself through college, Abuelhiga was still working a corporate job at an information technology company when she launched the Kickstarter campaign that helped her finance the launch of the Mason Dixie Biscuit Co. pop-up shop in 2014.

"""How was that?"" Chopra asked. ""It went great!"" said Stone. ""Wonderful!"" chimed in Banister. ""So weird!"" I muttered, to myself. I don't have anything against meditation. I was reacting to the fact that Chopra, Stone, Banister and two other people I'd been viewing via Zoom — Laura Ulloa, a peace activist, and Lars Buttler, cofounder and CEO of the AI Foundation and moderator of this panel discussion — were all digital personas created with artificial intelligence. That is, each one of them looked and sounded a lot like the person they were meant to represent. But these ersatz versions of their flesh-and-blood counterparts were built by Buttler's AI Foundation, a San Francisco company and nonprofit that promotes the idea that each of us should have our own AI identity.  Each avatar was trained by the person they emulate: The human was filmed making different consonant and vowel sounds, as well as answering a slew of questions to help the AI counterpart learn about how they speak and who they are. They are meant to be digital extensions that can communicate on behalf of their real selves. It's an idea that sounds both creepy and full of possibilities. Imagine sending your AI proxy to handle a day of work meetings, while you read a book. The conversation, which mostly centered around what it's like to have your own personal AI agent (neat, according to Stone's AI, as it could still be around after he dies), was part of the second annual  . Last year, this conference took place in San Francisco, with attendees watching speaker sessions at Fort Mason; this year, it was conducted online.  The conference, according to its website, is meant for ""exploring the growing impact of next-gen avatars on social networks, commerce, and the arts."" While the AI folks talking and meditating appeared to be logged in to the Zoom session from different locations  (Banister on a bench outdoors in front of a thicket of bamboo, Buttler in the AI Foundation office, and so on), the conference also included numerous speaker sessions hosted within the video game Animal Crossing, with each speaker embodied by a cute character. Regular people like me could view it all from afar via Zoom. Watching the panel of AI creations was transfixing, due to its proximity to realness and its feeling of spontaneity. It's the first conversation I've seen conducted in real time by AI creations modeled after actual humans, without a script. While there were shortcomings, such as the AI version of Buttler repeatedly saying ""Sorry about this"" as a technical glitch delayed Chopra's AI from getting online, it was fascinating to watch the AI speakers interact. At one point, Buttler's AI asked Chopra's if he's often asked questions about the universe, and the result felt weirdly natural.  ""Ah, yes."" he answered. ""People are often curious about what I believe the purpose of existence is."" What struck me immediately was the simultaneous sense of awe and Uncanny Valley-unease I felt just looking at the AI beings engage in conversation. They had a number of the mannerisms of regular people: Banister blinked regularly, Buttler's adam's apple moved occasionally, and Stone's shoulders shifted every so often. But they were unlike their real-world counterparts in some obvious ways. They were very human-like, but still looked kind of like animated characters and mostly existed only from the shoulders up. Their voices sounded stiff when they replied to questions, and there was always an unnaturally long pause between a query and answer. When they spoke, their mouths moved more like those of animatronic puppets than people or even cartoon characters. At the very end of the discussion, the real-life Buttler joined, making the strangeness of these AI creations even more pronounced. While the event wasn't scripted, the real-life Buttler told me that his AI had the set goal of asking the panelists what their purpose was, and each AI panelist was set to listen for its name being spoken so it would only give an answer when addressed directly. In general, if an AI being doesn't know the answer to a question, Buttler said, it's supposed to ask its corresponding human about it at another time. Most of the panelists have a connection to the AI Foundation: Stone is part of its AI council and nonprofit board, Chopra is also on the nonprofit board, and Banister is an investor. Buttler said each human ""owns"" their AI counterpart, and they were all aware that the AI version of themselves would be participating in this panel discussion. Different AI beings have been trained for different lengths of time; Buttler said Stone trained his AI for a few hours, while Chopra has spent ""dozens"" of hours working on his. The more you train it, the implication is, the more it will be a true representation of yourself. ""We don't want to replace human beings,"" Buttler said, soon adding, ""These are extensions of real people that help them do their jobs better.""  Banister, who watched part of the panel that included her AI avatar, wants the AI version of herself to be able to listen to pitches from entrepreneurs, enabling her to hear many more ideas than she ever could herself. In the present, though, she sees a more practical benefit to having her own AI persona. ""For the first time ever I wasn't stressed out about giving a talk,"" she said. ""So that was super nice."" ""Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to your heart. And mentally ask yourself only four questions: Who am I? What do I want? What am I grateful for? What's my purpose?"" Chopra said on Wednesday morning. He was speaking at a technology conference as part of a discussion, talking to fellow panelists including Twitter cofounder Biz Stone and venture capitalist Cyan Banister. The group kept their eyes closed as Chopra continued to speak. After another moment of guided meditation, he finished up; everyone opened their eyes.

"US officials say they're   over security concerns related to TikTok and its parent company, Beijing-based internet company ByteDance, following a similar decision by India. In the meantime, at least one US corporation is already taking action to restrict use of the app on company phones. The situation has TikTok scrambling to try to prove its reliability. At the same time, the company joined other big tech firms in   after China imposed a controversial national security law. And TikTok's competitors have proven eager to pounce on its challenges and try to win over its audience with similar offerings.  ""One of the things that troubles me about it is, it's something that is counter to the spirit of the internet,"" said Mark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford who teaches internet law.  ""I think something significant is lost there if the only apps we get are US apps or apps from approved countries. We lose out as consumers on technology that people like ... but in the long run the US also loses out economically, because we have been the great driver of the Internet."" TikTok has already lost access to one of the world's largest digital markets.

The app had been downloaded in India more than 660 million times since 2017, and some of its   live in the country.  Now, Trump administration officials are considering a similar measure.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News' Laura Ingraham earlier this month that the White House is ""looking at"" banning Chinese apps, including TikTok, and said US officials are ""taking this very seriously."" Pompeo added that people should only download TikTok ""if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."" On Wednesday, Pompeo said, ""we hope to have a set of decisions shortly"" with regards to the app.  ""We're working through a process where all the relevant agencies and the private sector are getting to say their piece,"" Pompeo said in a live interview with The Hill. ""Whether it's Tiktok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."" US politicians have repeatedly criticized TikTok, accusing it of being a threat to national security because its parent company is based in China and could be compelled to share data with the Chinese government. TikTok has called the concerns ""unfounded"" and   it's not clear that the app presents a true national security concern.  Talk of the potential ban also comes amid   over technology.  It's not just the Trump administration —  , including Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have also introduced legislation that would ban TikTok from US government devices. Both Democratic and Republican national committees have warned their staffs about using the app.     on Monday   from using the app on company devices because of security concerns.   ""Due to concerns about TikTok's privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices,"" a statement from a Wells Fargo spokesperson said.  The Wells Fargo decision came after       — but Amazon quickly backtracked on the request, saying it had been sent ""in error.""  For its part, TikTok says it operates separately from ByteDance.  TikTok's head of US public policy Michael Beckerman said   there is a lot of ""misinformation about TikTok right now.""  The company says it stores US user data in Virginia, with backup in Singapore, and ""we work to minimize access across regions,"" Beckerman said. TikTok also  ,     veteran Kevin Mayer, a move widely seen at least in part as an effort to win over US lawmakers.  But it appears even those steps may not be enough to alleviate the security concerns that threaten to undermine its growth, so the company   a corporate restructuring aimed further distancing itself from China. The changes could include establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country, according to  .  The company is also quickly expanding its presence in Washington DC. Beckerman said the company is creating so-called ""Transparency Centers"" in the nation's capital and in Los Angeles ""so that lawmakers and invited experts can see for themselves how we moderate content and keep our users' data secure."" ""We remain fully committed to protecting our users' privacy and security as we build a platform that inspires creativity and brings joy for hundreds of millions of people around the world,"" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to CNN last week.  Stanford's Lemley said the app's dedicated teen fanbase could also end up proving helpful.  ""Is there a revolt among the teenagers of the world?"" Lemley said. ""I say that jokingly, but only half jokingly. If a bunch of congressmen go to their teenagers and say they've banned their favorite app, there might be a lot of pushback and that could matter.""    efforts to overtake TikTok with a copycat app have so far been unsuccessful, but new bans could change that.

"It's the opposite of what's happening in most of the US, where the virus is surging and  .   Here's how some states have helped get coronavirus under control -- and what they're doing to make sure it stays that way:  Connecticut has consistently had one of the lowest rates of transmission (R numbers) of any state in the country.

That means fewer and fewer people are getting infected in the state.  And the number of new deaths has plummeted since April 26, when the seven-day average of daily deaths was 113.

And like New York and New Jersey, Connecticut has required  Even though Connecticut had some of the best numbers in the nation, Gov.

""But right now, with this pandemic flaring up in a majority of other states, this is not the time to take a risk."" Lamont also said the state would hold off on allowing outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people. New York started Phase 2 of its reopening on May 29, allowing office-based work, in-store retail shopping and some barbershop services to resume in much of the state. And between May 29 and July 10, average daily new cases in New York state has dropped about 55% -- from about 1,447 new cases a day to 651 cases a day, according to data from Johns Hopkins.

And at a time when testing was scarce across the country, New York tried to ramp up capabilities on its own. With FDA approval,   to start testing for coronavirus -- the first state to do so. ""We're hunting positives,"" Cuomo said in March. ""We're hunting positives so we can isolate them and reduce the spread."" New Yorkers tuned into Cuomo's daily briefings for updates on the virus and how to stay safe. During his 111th and final daily briefing on June 19, Cuomo said the state had gone "" .""

Between April 15 and July 14, Covid-19 , and the rate of new deaths has dropped by about 95%, according to data from the Massachusetts Department of Health.  Massachusetts waited to start reopening and  . It also enacted a mask mandate before most other states did, on May 6. But unlike some states, the mandate in Massachusetts   where it might not be possible to stay 6 feet away from others.  Massachusetts is doubling down on testing to try to snuff out coronavirus in the state.  This month, Gov. Charlie Baker announced a ""Stop the Spread"" testing initiative that will last until mid-August. The effort will focus on eight communities where the rates of Covid-19 are higher than the statewide average.    ""The goal of this initiative is to provide widespread asymptomatic testing in an easy-to-access location within these communities"" to help stop community spread, Baker said. And Massachusetts is aiming to resume classroom education this fall -- but with  . ""Students in grade 2 and above are required to wear a mask/face covering that covers their nose and mouth,"" according to  . The same applies to teachers and staff members.  For those unable to wear a mask, face shields may be used. And mask breaks should occur throughout the day if there's adequate distancing or ventilation.   New Jersey was hit hard early in this pandemic, with   and deaths soaring. The state has the highest rate of Covid-19 deaths per capita:  . But now, New Jersey is among just a handful of states on track to contain Covid-19, according to  , which tracks each state in four key areas: the infection rate, the test positivity rate, hospital capacity and contact tracing ability.  While testing has increased, the rate of new cases has decreased. New Jersey now has a test positivity rate of  . And the rate of transmission (Rt)  , which means fewer and fewer people are getting infected. In mid-March, Gov. Phil Murphy   and issued sweeping orders, including:  -- The closure of all schools and universities starting on March 18 -- The closure of all casinos, racetracks, theaters and gyms -- The closure of all nonessential retail, recreational and entertainment businesses after 8 p.m. each day New Jersey was the first state to issue a mask mandate, back on April 8. Businesses must provide masks to employees and deny entry to any customer who refuse to wear them inside the business. Those riding public transit in the state must also wear face masks. New Jersey also joined forces with New York and Connecticut on requiring visitors from hot-spot states to quarantine for 14 days. Officials are urging residents not to get complacent just because the numbers have improved. ""Our rate of transmission is in a good place today, but only a week ago ... it was above 1.0,"" the governor said Monday.

"Fauci was   this week when unnamed staffers released so-called ""opposition research"" on the doctor to reporters on Monday listing perceived errors in Fauci's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Then top White House trade adviser Peter Navarro   Tuesday in an op-ed in USA Today. """"Dr. Anthony Fauci has a good bedside manner with the public, but he has been wrong about everything I have interacted with him on,"" Navarro wrote in the op-ed.  President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has said he has ""a very good"" relationship with Fauci, who has   in more than a month. Fauci, for the most part, agreed with that assessment.  ""You know, it's complicated. Because in some respects I have a very good relationship with him. During the times that I was seeing him a fair amount, it was quite a collegial relationship. And in many respects, it probably still is, but I don't see him very much anymore,"" he said.  After weeks of Trump saying the pandemic is under control as it resurges in parts of the country, filling hospitals to near capacity and forcing states to rollback reopenings, Fauci has consistently warned of increasing case numbers and urged Americans to take the resurgence seriously, contradicting the president's statements on the deadly virus a number of times. But he told O'Donnell   about losing his job. ""I don't see any termination within the near future because I judge [my career] by my energy and my effectiveness. And right now, with all due modesty, I think I'm pretty effective,"" he said.  ""I certainly am energetic. And I think everybody thinks I'm doing more than an outstanding job. I have a wife with incredibly good judgment, who will probably give me the signal when it's time to step down. But I don't think we're anywhere near that right now,"" the 79-year-old Fauci said. The president can't fire Fauci from his NIAID job, but the doctor said he's willing to step down from the White House coronavirus task force, if Trump asked him to. In several candid moments, Fauci and Grady talked about their personal life, including how they met in 1983 at the National Institutes of Health while treating a patient, fell in love, got married two years later and had three daughters. Grady said when Fauci first called her into to his office after the patient visit, she was fearful he was going to fire her. Instead, he asked her out to dinner.

"But a number of communication and behavioral science experts say the WHO is definitely not alone in bungling some of its communication around the pandemic.  When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ditched the nationwide   and replaced it with ""stay alert,"" encouraging people who were unable to work from home to return to work at a time when the UK was still seeing high numbers of new cases, he created confusion that has taken a long time to clear up.  On Wednesday, his Health Secretary Matt Hancock struggled to explain why the government is now  , but not in other indoor spaces, such as pubs and offices. In the United States, the guidance on what is and isn't safe varies from state to state and city to city. This muddled messaging is a major problem.  The novel coronavirus spreads when  , so clear and consistent guidance on how to behave is crucial and experts say confusion over what to do -- and what not to do -- is a major problem that could cause real harm.  Because the virus is brand new, some uncertainty is inevitable. And advice may need to change over time.  ""The changes can lead to confusion, or even to charges that the experts don't know what they're talking about,"" crisis communication expert Peter M. Sandman told CNN in an email.  Masks are a good example of this.  Early in the pandemic, there were serious concerns about   for frontline medical workers. Some medical professionals also worried that masks could give people a false sense of security and stop them from following social distancing guidelines.  That's why some public health bodies, including WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, initially said healthy people shouldn't wear masks.  The US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams even went as far as saying masks were   in preventing general public from catching coronavirus.""  WHO struck a similar tone. ""There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program,  . But Sandman points to evidence from early February suggesting that infected people who   were transmitting the virus as they went about their daily lives in public places. At that time, he said, some experts ""at least suspected, even if they couldn't quite say they 'knew' it with full evidence-based confidence,"" that masks could help slow the spread. ""They certainly had no evidence base for claiming they knew it was not the case, which is what they claimed,"" Sandman added. As the world learned more about how the virus was being transmitted, health authorities and governments were forced to change their guidance. Earlier this week, the   to wear masks. But that flip-flopping has caused some people to question the validity of their new advice. Adams himself has recognized that it was   to correct the message. There are strategies that leaders can employ to minimize the problem, Sandman said -- for example by predicting that some changes may be necessary as more evidence emerges.  Acknowledging the unknown is a key part of successful communication in a crisis.  ""A consistent message is sometimes misinterpreted as: 'Let's make a bold statement one way or the other -- wear masks, don't wear masks.' But sometimes that message is: 'We don't have the full information,'"" said Heidi Tworek, a health communication expert and an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. Tworek said explaining the rationale behind the initial mask message would have prevented this confusion.  ""In Taiwan, the campaign basically said: 'Save the [medical grade] masks for the healthcare workers.' ... So you can have a consistent message that says: 'Masks are important and at this moment they are most important for health care workers and we're still looking into whether they're effective against this disease,'"" she said. Shane Timmons, a behavioral science researcher at the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin, said there was sometimes a reluctance among experts and politicians to highlight any uncertainty, for fear of undermining their expertise.  ""But what the evidence actually suggests, is that people are very willing to accept uncertainty when it's specified in clear terms. So if you say, 'These are the things we know, these are the things we don't know, this is how we're going to try to figure it out,' people will take that on board."" Sounding overconfident, Sandman said, is ""a crisis communication sin.""  The fact that guidance can change as more evidence emerges is nothing new in academic circles.  ""What makes it very challenging is that things that usually happen in journals and within small circles of scientists and public health officials -- the usual back and forth -- are now playing out in front of a global audience,"" Tworek said. Despite being the world's top public health body, WHO is a relatively small organization with a limited budget. In more ""normal"" times, it caters mainly to an expert audience. ""Its briefings aren't usually going to this many people, and that makes for a very, very different communication environment,"" explained Tworek. The confusion around the message on masks has caused huge disparities between countries in the willingness of people to wear them -- even as experts just about everywhere now agree that face coverings can help stop the spread of the virus.  One influential US model suggests that if 95% of Americans wore face masks in public, it   by October 1. But even the most straightforward guidance won't work if people question its rationale.  ""When people understand why they are being asked to do things, they're much more likely to do it,"" said Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology and the director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London.  She points to the ""don't touch your face"" and ""wash your hands"" guidance as an example.  ""It's about stopping the virus that could be on your fingers getting into your body, through your nose, your mouth or your eyes ... once people realize that that is how the virus gets into the body, then the not touching eyes, nose and mouth makes a lot of sense to people."" One of the biggest problems policymakers face when communicating the risks of this pandemic is what behavioral economists call the collective action problem.  For most people, the risk of dying as a result of Covid-19 is quite small. But in order for the pandemic to end, everyone -- even those perceived not to be at risk -- needs to make sacrifices.  ""Clear messaging is one of the key factors in determining whether people are willing to cooperate,"" Timmons said.  There may be different motivations. In the UK, the government spoke about the need to protect the   and save lives. In Ireland, the message was focused on taking care of each other. In some parts of the US, it's all about  . Acknowledging the unknown, providing consistent guidance and ""explaining the why"" are key ingredients of successful crisis communication strategy. But it doesn't end there.  ""It's about consistency between what you say and what you do. And this is one of the problems ... on the one hand, people are saying 'Oh, it's still a risky situation, be very careful,' and on the other hand, they are opening pubs,"" Michie said.  She said public health officials and governments need to get better at joining the dots and providing people with a strategy on how to navigate the situation.  ""Think about it as road safety -- we have to do our own risk assessment when crossing the road, for example,"" Michie said. ""Do we always cross the road just on the traffic lights or on zebra crossings, or do we occasionally cross it elsewhere? If we do, we probably consider several things, such as how far away are the cars, what speed are they traveling at, are the roads wet, how agile am I?"" One way to help people make decisions would be a simple coronavirus risk calculator that allows users to put in information about themselves in order to work out what level of danger they are facing and which situations to avoid, she added. Crucially, Michie said, those in authority must lead by example, and follow their own rules. Failure to do so risks muddying the message even further -- as seen in the US where President Donald Trump's months-long   contributed to the issue becoming a political debate, rather than a factual issue. Michie cites the example of politicians in the UK who ""are saying you need to wear [a mask] when you're on a bus, but we don't need to wear it when we're all squashed together in an indoor space in the House of Commons ... the   [trip] was the pinnacle of this,"" she said, referring to a controversial 260-mile car journey made by Boris Johnson's chief adviser at the height of lockdown. ""Undermining your message by saying 'it's fine for people to disobey the rules if they're us rather than you.'""  Photographs of the mask-less British treasury chief Rishi Sunak delivering meals in a newly reopened restaurant -- hours after his government told restaurants to make sure their staff wears protection -- didn't go down well, either.  Even the clearest guidance will never hit home if those at the top continue to ignore it. The World Health Organization's (WHO) apparent lack of clarity on whether people should wear   to help stop the spread of coronavirus is just one of its messages that has confused the public.   Last month, it had to clarify one official's   of the virus. Now it is facing criticism over how it communicated the danger posed by .

"""Nutritional exposures during the first 1,000 days of life not only contribute to long-term health but also help shape taste preferences and food choices."" Released Wednesday, these final recommendations are sent to the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, which use them to create the final 2020 to 2025 dietary guidelines that dictate much of what Americans will eat over the next five years.   The advisory group's recommendations ""are enormously influential,"" said nutrition researcher Marion Nestle, who has authored numerous books on food politics and marketing, including 2015's ""Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning).""  ""They govern food assistance programs, influence food industry marketing, and also influence the actual guidelines and food advice for the public,"" Nestle said. So how did this committee do, considering all the challenges of a short time frame, Covid-19 logistics and the need to add recommendations for the first two years of life? ""This is an impressive, solid, conservative review of the existing science highly consistent with previous Dietary Guidelines but with mostly stronger recommendations,"" Nestle said. ""At the outset, I was concerned that the committee members might be heavily biased in favor of food industry interests, she added. ""If they were, such biases do not show up in the final report.  I think this committee deserves much praise for producing a report of this quality under these circumstances."" One key message in the 2020 infant recommendations: No amount of added sugar is OK for a baby's development.  ""Avoid foods and beverages with added sugars during the first 2 years of life,"" the committee stated. ""The energy in such products is likely to displace energy from nutrient-dense foods, increasing the risk of nutrient inadequacies.  ""Moreover, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked with increased risk of overweight or obesity.""  Added sugars are used in processed foods and beverages to sweeten, and differ from the natural sugars that are part of a piece of fruit or glass of milk. ""Apples and oranges all contain sugar but they also provide fiber and overall nutrition,"" said pediatrician Dr. Steven Abrams, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.  ""Mother's milk has sugar in it,"" Abrams said, but it's packed full of immune boosting, infection fighting components and is the   of fats, proteins, carbohydrates and vitamins for a baby's needs.  However, while 100% fruit juice may appear to offer the same nutritional benefit as whole fruit, in reality it does not, according to the AAP. ""Fruit juice, especially for kids in the first year of life, is a source of sugar without many nutrient benefits,"" Abrams said. ""So this should always be avoided.""  Then between 1 and 3 years of age, kids should drink no more than 4 ounces per day of 100% fruit juice, the AAP suggests. The committee found that ""nearly 70 percent of added sugars intake comes from five food categories: sweetened beverages, desserts and sweet snacks, coffee and tea (with their additions), candy and sugars, and breakfast cereals and bars."" On a food label, added sugars can include ""brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, and sucrose,""  Parents should avoid added sugar in a child's diet, the committee recommends, because of the strong link to childhood obesity and future chronic health conditions.  Yet   has found that on average, infants consume a teaspoon of added sugar a day while toddlers consume about 6 teaspoons a day. ""Early life nutritional exposures have emerged as an etiological risk factor associated with later-life chronic disease risk,"" the report said. ""Every bite matters, which I think is a really good motto,"" said Abrams, who directs the Dell Pediatric Research Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. ""I like that a lot because it reminds you that what you're feeding the baby really does make a difference."" What about older children and adults? The committee dropped the recommended amount of added sugar from 10% of daily calories to 6% -- for an adult on a 2,000 calorie per day diet that means that less than 120 calories should come from added sugar each day.  To put that into perspective, one can of sugar-sweetened soda is about 150 calories. Breast milk contains healthy micronutrients important to a baby's development that can, for the most part, be influenced by a woman's diet and supplement use.  ""The strongest evidence found was that ever being breastfed may reduce the risk of overweight or obesity, type 1 diabetes, and asthma, compared to never being breastfed,"" the committee found. In their working draft, the committee found rapid weight gain was more likely among formula-fed infants than breastfed infants, possibly due to higher protein intake with formula or overfeeding by the caregiver so as not to ""waste"" food. Don't start first foods for baby before 4 months of age, the committee said. Research shows doing so is associated with an increased risk of obesity at 2 to 12 years. That appeared to be especially true for infants who are formula fed, as they may not be able to regulate their feelings of ""fullness"" as well as breastfed infants. The committee also encouraged women to more closely adhere to healthy eating recommendations before and during pregnancy. ""Though the diets of women who are pregnant or lactating are higher in key food groups, they still fall below recommendations,"" the report said. ""The risk of chronic disease begins early in life, with important health consequences for the fetus based on the dietary intake of the mother and subsequent feeding behaviors in infancy and early childhood."" Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids is a key benefit for both pregnant women and newborns, the committee found. It may be related to reduced risk of gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, while also reducing risk of preterm birth.  Eating at least 8 to 12 ounces each week of a variety of seafood high in omega-3 and   -- such as crab, oysters, salmon, sardines, scallops, shrimp, squid and tilapia -- may also boost cognitive development and language and communication development in children.  Possible areas of nutritional concern in baby's development revolve around iron, zinc and vitamin D. Because breast milk doesn't contain adequate amounts of vitamin D unless the mother is supplementing at high levels, the committee followed the AAP's guidelines: Give fully and partially breastfed babies 400 IU of vitamin D from birth until the baby is weaned and drinking vitamin D-fortified cow's milk or infant formula. There's no need to go above that level, the committee said: ""The existing body of evidence does not provide a basis for recommending vitamin D supplementation above 400 IU per day during infancy.""  Iron is important for ""normal neurological development and immune function,"" the committee said, adding that studies show that both iron and zinc decline in breastfed infants by six months.  Therefore, parents of breastfed babies should feed foods like meat that are rich in iron and zinc during the second six months of life, or fortify with iron-enriched foods such as infant cereals.  Be careful, however, since too much iron can also be harmful. Formula-fed babies may get a double dose of iron if they are eating cereals as well. The committee does not recommend iron supplements for babies, unless they are screened by a doctor and found to be deficient. It's also important to give baby adequate amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the committee recommended, because of the important role they play in brain development. Key sources are fish, fish oil, vegetable oil, nuts and seeds. The committee also found introducing peanuts and eggs, ""in an age appropriate form,"" after 4 months of age may reduce the risk of food allergy to these foods. While the evidence wasn't as strong for other allergens such as nuts and seafood, there was also no harm in introducing such potentially allergic foods. Here's a shocker for men who drink: The committee is suggesting reducing current guidance for two drinks for men and one drink a day for women. ""Recommended limits for both men and women who drink would be 1 drink per day on days when alcohol is consumed,"" the report said. Research has indicated higher average alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, so ""those who do not drink should not begin to drink because they believe alcohol would make them healthier."" What's missing from this analysis? The committee didn't tackle the topic of red meat -- a major supplier of saturated fat in the American diet and a huge player in the argument over food sustainability and    Sodium and salt and their role in the growing epidemic of hypertension and heart disease was also not part of the committee's assignment. ""The report says remarkably little about sodium beyond that it is overconsumed and people should 'reduce sodium intake,'"" Nestle said. The committee didn't address drinking water over other beverages for hydration. Nor did they touch on the need to limit the American fascination with overly processed foods that lose nutritional value as their shelf life expands. ""Ultraprocessed"" is the new way of talking about foods that should not be consumed regularly or in large amounts — tons of evidence has come in within the last five years,"" Nestle said.  ""The word does not appear in the report except in the references,"" Nestle said. ""If the committee considered this evidence, it did not spell it out explicitly."" Those issues aren't addressed, critics say, because the independence of the 2020 Dietary Advisory Committee was removed by the federal government. ""For the first time in the 40-year history of the Dietary Guidelines, the agencies — USDA and HHS — set the scientific agenda, not the committee,"" Nestle said.  While we don't know if the committee would have considered other topics, ""sustainability, meat, sodium, and ultraprocessed foods are the hot nutrition topics these days and getting the committee's take on these issues would have been a big help,"" Nestle said. That's the takeaway from the   a group of experts charged with providing science-based recommendations twice each decade on how our diet affects our health. ""This report continues the traditional emphasis on individuals ages 2 years and older and, for the first time, expands upon it to reflect the growing body of evidence about appropriate nutrition during the earliest stages of life,"" the report stated.

"""I felt I need to -- I need to help the health workers,"" Tsai said in his Wednesday appearance on  . ""You know, they put their lives at risk. What I know can help them.""  . Tsai patented the technology used to make the masks in 1995.  : To block up to 95% of the particles that come in contact with the mask, Tsai made the filters using the corona electrostatic charging method. Put simply, the mask's filter contains both positive and negative charges. It can attract neutral particles, like bacteria from viruses, and polarize those particles, trapping them before they can pass through the mask. But when Tsai heard about physicians and nurses who were treating coronavirus patients  , he got back to work. Tsai dug in at  , working up to 20 hours a day to test new ways to sterilize the masks. He tried a variety of methods: He left the masks out in the sun, put them in the oven, washed them with soap and steamed them, he said.  The best method, he found, was keeping the masks in 160-degree dry heat for 30 minutes, which can be feasibly done by hanging them in an oven.  But that's not his preferred method, he told Gupta: He recommends buying seven N95 masks and rotating them, using a new one each day. After using one mask, he hangs it in an isolated spot and doesn't use it again for seven days, so any bacteria it catches become inactive.  N95 respirators are the most effective face covering, but the  the public purchasing and wearing them. They're fitted to fit physicians' faces and can often become uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time, and if the public buys them up, healthcare workers could face a severe shortage of them.  But people should absolutely wear masks in public, even if they're not N95 respirators, Tsai told Gupta.  ""Some people said, 'I don't care. I do not need to wear a mask,'"" he said. ""That is very selfish because you expose your germs to other people. So any mask is good.""

"But there hasn't been much data to show whether it works or not. So the researchers gathered and analyzed information on daily reported cases from 149 countries or regions both before and after five different physical or social distancing measures were put into place.  The measures were: school closures, workplace closures, public transport closures, restrictions on mass gatherings and lockdown restrictions on people's movement within countries or regions.   They found that on average, any physical distancing measure was associated with an overall reduction in Covid-19 incidence of 13% over the study period. Restriction on mass gatherings, in combination with school and workplace closure, appeared to be a key component associated with a decrease in Covid-19 incidence,   On the other hand, closing public transport was not associated with any additional benefit when the other four measures were already in place, suggesting that public transport could remain open ""especially for those working in vital services, including health, care giving and emergency response roles.""   The order in which these measures were put in place did not appear to matter, but when the estimates from all the countries were pooled together, the researchers found a greater reduction in incidence of Covid-19 was associated with earlier, rather than later, implementation of lockdown.   In  , Thomas May, a research professor at the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State University, praised the researchers for using real-world data in their modeling, but pointed out that this strength is also problematic.    ""Unfortunately, using such results is also the study's greatest weakness, making analysis dependent on the quality of the data from testing. Specifically, the authors relied on 'daily reported cases' compiled from 149 independent countries; data subject to variable quality, accuracy and inconsistent testing practices,"" May wrote.  ""As a result, caution is warranted when interpreting the findings,"" he added.  As an example, he points out that data from the United States, is ""less than ideal"" due to variation in testing practices from location to location, a lack of tests earlier in the pandemic and the lumping together of antibody testing from testing for active disease -- all of which weaken the associations that can be drawn.  Although the study provides support for physical distancing, it ""cannot be definitive for the reasons outlined.""  But, he added, the measures probably are effective. But one expert cautioned that the findings, however ""politically convenient"" they might be, are based on flawed data and should not be thought of as conclusive, but rather suggestive.  With currently almost 13.5 million confirmed cases worldwide and a lack of effective treatment or a vaccine, ""the most pragmatic recommendation has been to advise physical distancing (referred to by some as social distancing) to minimize person-to-person transmission with a view to flattening the epidemic curve,"" wrote the study authors, led by Dr. Nazrul Islam, Oxford University physician-epidemiologist and medical statistician.

"At the end of two weeks, the study found that there was no advantage to taking the drug. About 24% of the hydroxychloroquine group had symptoms that persisted over 14 days, compared to the 30% who took the placebo. But hospitalizations were nearly the same -- 2% of those in the hydroxychloroquine group were hospitalized, compared to the 3% taking the placebo. The death rate was identical for both groups, at 0.4%. And, 43% of those who took hydroxychloroquine had side effects, compared to the 22% that took a placebo. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most commonly reported side effect. The study also found there was no benefit seen among people who took zinc or vitamin C along with the placebo or hydroxychloroquine.  The University of Minnesota researchers' first randomized trial, published in the   in June, looked at the drug as a possible post-exposure prophylaxis for adults who had been recently exposed to someone who had Covid-19. The study showed hydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness. ""Taken together, there is no convincing evidence that hydroxychloroquine can either prevent COVID-19 after exposure or reduce illness severity after developing early symptoms,"" study author Dr. Caleb Skipper said in a press statement. ""While disappointing, these results are consistent with an emerging body of literature that hydroxychloroquine doesn't convey a substantial clinical benefit in people diagnosed with COVID-19 — despite its activity against the coronavirus in a test tube.""   of 293 Covid-19 patients in Barcelona found similar results: Hydroxychloroquine did not benefit non-hospitalized patients with mild Covid-19.

One study published this month by researchers at   Health System in Southeast Michigan found hydroxychloroquine increased hospitalized patients' chances of survival. However, researchers not involved with the study were  , saying it wasn't of the same quality of the previous studies that showed hydroxychloroquine did not help patients. Scientists from University of Minnesota launched the trial March 22 to see if the drug could decrease the severity of symptoms and prevent hospitalization. Previous randomized clinical trials in the United States had looked at hydroxychloroquine as prevention, or as treatment for hospitalized coronavirus patients. It was tested in 491 adults in the United States and Canada. Half the patients received five days of hydroxychloroquine treatment and half the patients received five days of a placebo. The adults were enrolled within the first four days of reporting symptoms, and 56% were enrolled in the trial the first day they reported any symptoms.

"On Thursday morning, HHS said it was directing the agency to put the data back up. ""HHS is committed to being transparent with the American public about the information it is collecting on the coronavirus. Therefore, HHS has directed CDC to re-establish the coronavirus dashboards it withdrew from the public on Wednesday,"" Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Michael Caputo said Thursday. ""Going forward, HHS and CDC will deliver more powerful insights on the coronavirus, powered by HHS Protect,"" said Caputo. HHS Protect is the department's coronavirus information center. The White House has been asking hospitals to provide the coronavirus data on a daily basis since March. The dashboard modules were restored Thursday. CDC has also added language to its website saying the data would not be updated past July 14.  The information was on the  and the CDC's Covid-19 data tracker. Public health experts had objected vociferously to HHS's decision to bypass CDC.  ""Given how political the response has been to date, it's a step backwards to have these data going directly to HHS in Washington,"" former CDC interim director Dr. Richard Besser told CNN. ""The disruption that they're going to create, and confusion simply telling people to do something different in the middle of a disaster -- that does not work,"" American Public Health Association Executive Director Dr. Georges Benjamin told CNN.  ""It's like telling a soldier in the middle of a battle 'we want you to fight differently than we trained you.' Doesn't work."" The Infectious Diseases Society of America called the decision ""troubling."" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany later denied that HHS had ever planned to remove data from the CDC website. ""No one is taking access or data away from the CDC and that data is routinely published so that the American people are fully informed,"" she told reporters Thursday. ""The CDC database is the public data that's been out there. It will continue to be public. It should be public.""

"Since Covid-19 was a new disease and since information about symptoms was limited, especially among patients that hadn't been hospitalized, the CDC sent a further survey to patients identified by local health leaders. The patients were asked to report on a wide variety of symptoms and also asked to report on any additional symptoms that were not widely recognized.    Among these patients, nearly all -- 96% -- had had either a fever, cough, or shortness of breath and about 45% experienced all three.    Cough was the most common symptom: 84% of surveyed patients said they had a cough, the team of CDC and state health officials found. Fever was the next most common symptom, with 80% of patients reporting they had a fever. Shortness of breath was more commonly associated with people who were hospitalized.   Patients also experienced a wide variety of other symptoms including muscle pain, chills, fatigue and headache. At least one stomach issue, most commonly diarrhea, was each reported by half of the patients. Some patients also reported GI symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.   A higher percentage of people who did not have to go to the hospital lost their sense of taste or smell.     These results are not generalizable, since testing was restricted to certain patients during this time period and hospitalized patients are likely overrepresented in the sample of people surveyed, but the data does give doctors a better sense of who might need to be tested or even isolated to slow the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Now, as Covid-19 cases  , he has found new ways to help those in his program. In Colombia, there have been  . More than 6,000 people have died. The numbers continue to rise rapidly, threatening the livelihood of Colombians who are on a countrywide quarantine until at least August 1.  ""We've been taking all the safety measures to avoid affecting our health and the health of others,"" said Aristizábal, 37. Normally, his organization runs a school and medical clinic and provides speech, physical, and occupational therapy. The group also has a meal program and a job training initiative. To ensure everyone's safety, the organization temporarily closed its center and ceased in-person classes. But Aristizábal and his team quickly put remote learning into action.  They are also providing in-home and virtual medical treatment and physiotherapy. ""They won't be able to have the same things that they had here at the foundation,"" Aristizábal said, ""but we're making the effort so that the children's situation doesn't worsen."" Ultimately, he hopes their efforts inspire the community to stay positive and overcome the challenges facing them. ""It's important to give the best of ourselves in these moments,"" he said. ""If we set our hope and we set our will, we can rise above all the adversities."" CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Aristizábal about his recent work. Below is an edited, translated version of their conversation. How has the Covid-19 situation in Cali affected the families in your program?    The infections started in the area where there are more people with economic power, people who travel. and then has increased in the Aguablanca district, where we run our foundation. Many of our foundation families are among the people who do cleaning, delivery service, maintenance. Many of them can't stay totally quarantined because they live day to day; they are humble families that need to work to get food. We've had infections within some families with children in the foundation. We unfortunately found out about the death of a father of a child in the program. Obviously, to the extent in which the pandemic continues, we will continue with the quarantine. The hospital infrastructure in Colombia is a lot smaller and more precarious. A wave of mass infections and hospitalized people -- the hospital system in Cali wouldn't be able to withstand that. What are some of the issues facing the kids in your program right now?   What most concerns me is I want to guarantee that they have a good diet. The children here at the foundation were given their breakfasts and lunches and they have a nutritionist to make sure they have a balanced diet filled with nutrients. If they lose their diet, their medical situation will get even more complicated. That's why we've really worked (to get) the children's groceries.  Another concern is accessing medical treatment and therapies. Unfortunately, the children haven't been able to return to the center, which for them is grave because many of them depend on their treatments to maintain their state of health. For children with disabilities, physiotherapy is especially important. We've really done a huge effort so they can continue receiving (those) from home.  The emotional and psychological part has really affected them. The prolonged confinement due to the isolation has caused more stress to these children. They really, really miss the foundation; this is their second home. How is your group supporting the children and families in your program?  We've managed to provide groceries every two weeks to each family. We've had success with the families having a permanent food supply.  We have two ways of providing (physiotherapy) to the kids now. The medical providers go from home to home to give the therapies. The physiotherapist also shows the family how to do the therapy at home. We have another really nice sports program for people with disabilities. So, via the internet, we have (those) classes, which end up being therapy -- so that they can move their arms, their hands, and not relapse after everything we've gained. We're doing all our school programs through virtual classes so they can study in their homes. We've also been teaching them to make bread via the internet. We're giving psychological support. The psychologists from the foundation make phone calls to the families and are providing emotional support for each one of the children.  We've done all of this to guarantee that the children's health conditions don't worsen due to this quarantine. What advice do you have for people during this difficult time?  The message of not losing hope is fundamental in these moments. Because many people have lost their jobs, have lost a life that we call normal, now we're thinking that it's all bad. And it's not -- it's telling them there has to be hope because that's what permits us to get up with optimism, with the will to fight so that things get better every day, despite the changes that we're living.  In the end, when we have dreams, that's a motor that ignites life. It's not an easy situation, but you have to put in the effort and a lot of desire to move forward -- and have solidarity and heart. Put the effort into life, our dreams, everything we're doing. That is the great message that we've carried to families, to the children and the entire community. As a young man with cerebral palsy, Aristizábal has fought his entire life to overcome the obstacles in his way.  Today, his non-profit,   -- an acronym that translates to Association of Disabled People of the Valley -- offers a range of services that have helped transform the lives of more than 1,100 young people and their families.
